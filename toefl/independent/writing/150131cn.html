          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>By the time it is over, young generation in modern days often complains about the heavy burden and pressure they have to suffer. In fact, there is a starting point for bigger arguments about whether the rules that the whole society expects young people to follow are too strict. In my opinion, I prefer to agree the statement because modern young people are expected to perform well in the school, meet high level of requirement in the work.</p>
          <p>　　First, nowadays youngsters need to make every effort to satisfy their parents’ high expectation. At present, most of parents believe that their children must face the fierce competition when seeking a wonderful job. Thus, in order to help their children equip a better working capacity, parents steadily require their kids to try hard and then present excellent academic performance. Indeed, in high school, it is normal for the youngsters that attending many extra courses or examinations after school. In addition, some extra skills and knowledge that the youth need to grasp are emphasized by the elders. For example, even in elementary school, students are cultivated to learn many other skills, like singing, painting, or playing musical instruments, for competing with other children but not for their own interest.</p>
          <p>　　Second, in recruiting a qualified employee, the company looks for evidence of all-round ability. With the development of the economic by bounds and leaps, increasingly numbers of talents are needed in this society. When a young man wants to find a high salary job, he or she has to meet different requirements from the senior managers. For example, the staffs are expected to clearly identify the problem and put together a business plan to implement. They also need to make decision in crisis or uncertainty. In addition, they should be able to work effectively with each other in a team. However in the past, the youngsters just entering a firm only are required to be qualified with the basic knowledge and technique and common sense, instead of some other qualities needed in modern workplace.</p>
          <p>　　It is true that some young people could not obey those strict rules due to their parents’ tolerance or help. Those youngsters could live in a freer environment to do things they really interested in. But it is not a general phenomenon that most of the young generation could have an ideal life based on their own minds. Main of the young, the really normal ones, has to follow the rules regulated by the whole society already.</p>
          <p>　　From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw the conclusion that the rules made by the society are too strict for young people because they have to meet the high requirement in learning and working. It is afraid that, for most young people, they really hope that they could have chances to escape from these rules.</p>
