          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>To know the famous historical city which I am located in, I prefer the second way, that is, to visit the old people in the city. For example, there is a cleaner who pushes a garbage truck, walking in the streets of the city every day. When I am free, I hear and chat with the old man, surely I feel the strong academic atmosphere of the city and learn about the story of many celebrities. Once a few tourists asked for the way, he not only showed them the way, also told them the origin and history of the road, to his surprise, the tourists were captivated by him. Later, many of the tourists name him as a tour guide, and he always makes them satisfied. So I believe the second way is very helpful. (136 words)</p>

          <p>Shooting videos is what I thinkthe best way to carry out a history project. Carefully made videos are morelikely to be effective attention grabbers. We can use videos to record thevisual facts and sounds. Like last time, when my historical architecture groupwas starting off with a project about some old buildings from Ming Dynasty in asmall village, we took several trips there. Sometimes the weather was goodwhile sometimes it rained or anything. With the digital single lens camera, wemanaged to capture the beauty of the buildings in different lights. Also,videos of high quality nowadays can go viral on the Internet within days. Wecan absolutely post the videos on various social media platforms and promotethem to attract attention on a large scale.</p>

          <h4>Sample Response</h4>
          <p>I agree with the idea that students are graded only by written work, such as research paper, etc. Writing needs thinking. It's a way to cultivate students' thinking ability.  Also it benefits students' ability of reading, analyzing and organizing. With the topic, they must collect related materials and do some research, such as questionnaire, field study, case study, etc, which are beneficial to them. Furthermore, an excellent paper can get recognition from others. This may greatly encourage students and boost their self-confidence, in turn, students can create more valuable written work.

          <p>　Class discussions should surelybe involved in the evaluation of students, because students’ participation inclass discussions clearly shows their certain abilities and how well they haveabsorbed the points from the lectures. As a literature student, I feel I amgreatly motivated by the requirement of engagement in discussions. I have tobetter prepare my preview in order to answer some warm-up questions from myteachers and offer some constructive perspectives while discussing some topicsfrom the literary works we are studying. Also, the ability to articulate andexpress oneself matters in workplaces. According to some HRs, this is also whatthey will look at when they are selecting potential assets for companies.Making class discussions part of the grade is naturally necessary for raisingstudents’ awareness.</p>
