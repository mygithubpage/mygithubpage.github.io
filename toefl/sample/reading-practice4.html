            <h4 class="w3-center">Aggression</h4>
            <p>When one animal attacks another, it engages in the most obvious example of aggressive behavior. Psychologists have adopted several approaches to understanding aggressive behavior in people.</p>
            <p>The Biological Approach. Numerous biological structures and chemicals appear to be involved in aggression. One is the hypothalamus, a region of the brain. In response to certain stimuli, many animals show instinctive aggressive reactions. The hypothalamus appears to be involved in this inborn reaction pattern: electrical stimulation of part of the hypothalamus triggers stereotypical aggressive behaviors in many animals. In people, however, whose brains are more complex, other brain structures apparently moderate possible instincts.</p>
            <p>An offshoot of the biological approach called sociobiology suggests that aggression is natural and even desirable for people. Sociobiology views much social behavior, including aggressive behavior, as genetically determined. Consider Darwin's theory of evolution. Darwin held that many more individuals are produced than can find food and survive into adulthood. A struggle for survival follows. Those individuals who possess characteristics that provide them with an advantage in the struggle for existence are more likely to survive and contribute their genes to the next generation. In many species, such characteristics include aggressiveness. Because aggressive individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce, whatever genes are linked to aggressive behavior are more likely to be transmitted to subsequent generations.</p>
            <p>The sociobiology view has been attacked on numerous grounds. One is that people's capacity to outwit other species, not their aggressiveness, appears to be the dominant factor in human survival. Another is that there is too much variation among people to believe that they are dominated by, or at the mercy of, aggressive impulses.</p>
            <p>The Psychodynamic Approach. Theorists adopting the psychodynamic approach hold that inner conflicts are crucial for understanding human behavior, including aggression. Sigmund Freud, for example, believed that aggressive impulses are <span class="question3">inevitable</span> reactions to the frustrations of daily life. Children normally desire to vent aggressive impulses on other people, including their parents, because even the most attentive parents cannot <span class="question4">gratify</span> all of their demands immediately. Yet children, also fearing their parents' punishment and the loss of parental love, come to repress most aggressive impulses. The Freudian perspective, in a sense: sees us as "<span class="question7">steam engines</span>." By holding in rather than venting "steam," we set the stage for future explosions. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span> Pent-up aggressive impulses demand outlets. <span class="question5">They</span> may be expressed toward parents in indirect ways such as destroying furniture, or they may be expressed toward strangers later in life.</p>
            <p>According to psychodynamic theory, the best ways to prevent harmful aggression may be to encourage less harmful aggression. In the steam-engine analogy, verbal aggression may vent some of the aggressive steam. So might cheering on one's favorite sports team. Psychoanalysts, therapists adopting a psychodynamic approach, refer to the venting of aggressive impulses as "catharsis." Catharsis is theorized to be a safety valve. But research findings on the usefulness of catharsis are mixed. Some studies suggest that catharsis leads to reductions in tension and a lowered likelihood of future aggression. Other studies, however, suggest that letting some steam escape actually encourages more aggression later on.</p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>The Cognitive Approach. Cognitive psychologists assert that our behavior is influenced by our values, by the ways in which we interpret our situations and by choice. <span class="question8">For example, people who believe that aggression is necessary and justified-as during wartime-are likely to act aggressively, whereas people who believe that a particular war or act of aggression is unjust, or who think that aggression is never justified, are less likely to behave aggressively.</span></p>
            <p>One cognitive theory suggests that aggravating and painful events trigger unpleasant feelings. These feelings, in turn, can lead to aggressive action, but not automatically. Cognitive factors intervene. People decide whether they will act aggressively or not on the basis of factors such as their experiences with aggression and their interpretation of other people's motives. Supporting evidence comes from research showing that aggressive people often <span class="question10">distort</span> other people's motives. For example, they assume that other people mean them harm when they do not.</p>
            <p>Catharsis: In psychodynamic theory, the purging of strong emotions or the relieving of tensions.</p>

              <div class="explanation">This is a Rhetorical Purpose question. If asks you why the author mentions that Freud described people as "steam engines" in the passage. The phrase being tested is highlighted in the passage. The correct answer is choice 3, "must vent their aggression to prevent it from building up.'' Steam engines will explode if their steam builds up The same is true of people, as choice 3 indicates. The other choices are not necessarily true of both people and steam engines, so they are incorrect.</div>

              <div class="explanation">The correct answer is choice 2. It contains all of the essential information in the highlighted sentence. The highlighted sentence compares people who believe particular acts of aggression are necessary and those who don't, in terms of their relative likelihood to act aggressively under certain conditions. This is precisely what choice 2 says: "People who believe that aggression is necessary and justified are more likely to act aggressively than those who believe differently." It compares the behavior of one type of person to that of another type of person. Nothing essential has been left out, and the meaning has not been changed. Choice 1 changes the meaning of the sentence; it says categorically that "those (people) who believe that they are fighting an unjust war do not (act aggressively)." The highlighted sentence merely says that such people are "less likely" to act aggressively, not that they never will; this changes the meaning. Choice 3 says, "People who normally do not believe that aggression is necessary and justified may act aggressively during wartime." This is incorrect because it leaves out critical information: it does not mention people who do believe aggression is necessary. This choice does not make the same comparison as the highlighted sentence. Choice 4, "People who believe that aggression is necessary and justified do not necessarily act aggressively during wartime," also changes the meaning of the sentence by leaving out essential information. In this choice, no mention is made of people who do not believe aggression is necessary. This choice does not make the same comparison as the highlighted sentence.</div>

              <div class="explanation">This is a Negative Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraphs 7 and 8. Choice 3 is the correct answer. Choice 1, "moral values," is explicitly mentioned as one of the influences on aggressive behavior; so it is incorrect. Choices 2 ("previous experiences") and 4 sentence in paragraph8 says, "People decide whether they will act aggressively of not on the basis of factors such as their experiences with aggression and their interpretation of other people's motives." Choice 3, the "instinct to avoid aggression," is not mentioned, so it is the correct answer here.</div>

              <div class="explanation">The sentence provided, "According to Freud, however, impulses that have been repressed continue to exist and demand expression," is best inserted at square 2. Square 2 is correct because the sentence being inserted is a connective sentence, connecting the idea of childhood repression in the preceding sentence to the "Freudian perspective" in the sentence that follows. The use of the word however in this sentence indicates that an idea already introduced (the repression of children's aggressive impulses) is being modified. Here, the inserted sentence tells us that Freud thought that even though these impulses are repressed, they continue to exist. This serves as a connection to the next sentence and the "Freudian perspective." Inserting the sentence at square 1 would place the modification ("however, impulses . . . continue to exist") before the idea that it modifies (repression of impulses). This makes no logical sense. Inserting the sentence at square 3 would move the modifying sentence away from its logical position immediately following the idea that it modifies (repression of impulses). Placing the insert sentence at square 4 moves the sentence farther from its logical antecedent and has no connection to the sentence that follows it.</div>

              <div class="explanation">
                <p>Choice 1: "Aggressive impulses toward people are sometimes expressed in indirect ways" belongs in the Psychodynamic Approach row based on paragraph5. That paragraph, in explaining the Psychodynamic Approach, states that "Pent-up aggressive impulses demand outlets. They may be expressed toward parents in indirect ways such as destroying furniture . . ."</p>
                <p>Choice 2: "Aggressiveness is often useful for individuals in the struggle for survival "belongs in the Biological Approach row because, as stated in paragraph3, "An offshoot of the biological approach called sociobiology suggests that aggression is natural and even desirable for people." The remainder of that paragraph explains the ways in which aggressive behavior can be useful in the struggle for survival. Neither of the other approaches discusses this idea, so this answer choice belongs here.</p>
                <p>Choice 3: "Aggressive behavior may involve a misunderstanding of other people's intentions" belongs in the Cognitive Approach row based on paragraph 8. The theme of that paragraph is that people decide to be aggressive (or not) largely based upon their interpretations of other people's motives. It goes on to say that these interpretations may be "distorted," or misunderstood. Accordingly, this answer choice belongs in this row.</p>
                <p>Choice 5: "Acting aggressively is the result of a choice influenced by a person's values and beliefs" belongs in the Cognitive Approach row based on paragraph7 which states, "Cognitive psychologists assert that our behavior is influenced by our values, by the ways in which we interpret our situations, and by choice." Thus, this is an important aspect of the cognitive approach.</p>
                <p>Choice 6: "Repressing aggressive impulses can result in aggressive behavior" belongs in the Psychodynamic Approach row based on paragraphs 5 and 6.Both of those paragraphs explicitly make this point in the section of the passage on the Psychodynamic Approach.</p>
                <p>Choice 4: "The need to express aggressive impulses declines with age" is not mentioned in connection with any of the approaches to aggression discussed in the passage, so it should not be used.</p>
