            <h5>Comment</h5>
            <p>This response meets the criteria at score level 3. In this response, the speech is very clear and easy to understand. The speaker begins by naming the memorable event she will talk about: a farewell party that was given for her when she left middle school. She provides a simple but good explanation for why this was a memorable event, using simple but accurate vocabulary. This response might have received a higher score if the explanation had been developed further and with greater specificity and clearer connections between the ideas. In spite of those limitations, the response addresses the task appropriately by talking about an event and communicating two memorable aspects of it in a sustained, relevant, coherent, and intelligible way.</p>
