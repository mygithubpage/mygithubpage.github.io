            <span class="time" data-times="4.9" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to a <span class="highlight">conversation</span> between a student and a professor.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.02" data-time="4.9">[00:04.90]</span>Student: Uh, excuse me, Professor Thompson. <span class="time" data-times="6.06" data-time="6.92">[00:06.92]</span>I know your office hours are tomorrow, but I was wondering if you had a few minutes free now to discuss something.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.83" data-time="12.98">[00:12.98]</span>Professor: Sure, John. What did you want to talk about?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="14.81">[00:14.81]</span>Student: Well, I have some quick questions about how to write up the research <span class="highlight">project</span> I did this <span class="highlight">semester</span>-about <span class="highlight">climate</span> variations.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.26" data-time="21.34">[00:21.34]</span>Professor: Oh, yes. <span class="time" data-times="3.62" data-time="22.6">[00:22.60]</span>You were looking at variations in <span class="highlight">climate</span> in the <span class="highlight">Grant</span> City area, right? <span class="time" data-times="1.71" data-time="26.22">[00:26.22]</span>How far <span class="highlight">along</span> have you gotten?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.15" data-time="27.93">[00:27.93]</span>Student: I've got all my <span class="highlight">data</span>, so I'm starting to <span class="highlight">summarize</span> it now, preparing graphs and <span class="highlight">stuff</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.69" data-time="33.08">[00:33.08]</span>But I'm just. . . I'm looking at it and I'm afraid that it's not enough, but I'm not sure what else to put in the <span class="highlight">report</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.28" data-time="38.77">[00:38.77]</span>Professor: I hear the same thing from every student. <span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="41.05">[00:41.05]</span>You know, you have to remember now that you're the expert on what you've done. <span class="time" data-times="8.96" data-time="44.87">[00:44.87]</span>So, think about what you'd need to include if you were going to explain your research <span class="highlight">project</span> to someone with general or <span class="highlight">casual</span> knowledge about the <span class="highlight">subject</span>, like . . . like your parents. <span class="time" data-times="3.59" data-time="53.83">[00:53.83]</span>That's usually my rule of thumb: would my parents understand this?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.35" data-time="57.42">[00:57.42]</span>Student: OK. I get it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="58.77">[00:58.77]</span>Professor: I hope you can <span class="highlight">recognize</span> by my saying that how much you do know about the <span class="highlight">subject</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.6" data-time="63.05">[01:03.05]</span>Student: Right. I understand. <span class="time" data-times="5.45" data-time="64.65">[01:04.65]</span>I was wondering if I should also include the notes from the research <span class="highlight">journal</span> you suggested I keep.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.28" data-time="70.1">[01:10.10]</span>Professor: Yes, <span class="highlight">definitely</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="71.38">[01:11.38]</span>You should use them to <span class="highlight">indicate</span> what your <span class="highlight">evolution</span> in thought was <span class="highlight">through</span> time. <span class="time" data-times="9.32" data-time="75.45">[01:15.45]</span>So, just set up, you know, what was the purpose of what you were doing-to try to understand the <span class="highlight">climate</span> <span class="highlight">variability</span> of this area-and what you did, and what your <span class="highlight">approach</span> was.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="84.77">[01:24.77]</span>Student: OK. So, for example, I studied <span class="highlight">meteorological</span> records. <span class="time" data-times="1.92" data-time="88.83">[01:28.83]</span>I looked at <span class="highlight">climate</span> charts. <span class="time" data-times="6.17" data-time="90.75">[01:30.75]</span>I used different methods for analyzing the <span class="highlight">data</span>, like certain <span class="highlight">statistical</span> tests, and then I discuss the results. <span class="time" data-times="1.13" data-time="96.92">[01:36.92]</span>Is that what you mean?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.93" data-time="98.05">[01:38.05]</span>Professor: Yes, that's right. <span class="time" data-times="1.97" data-time="98.98">[01:38.98]</span>You should include all of that. <span class="time" data-times="2.64" data-time="100.95">[01:40.95]</span>The <span class="highlight">statistical</span> tests are especially important. <span class="time" data-times="7.75" data-time="103.59">[01:43.59]</span>And also be sure you include a good <span class="highlight">reference</span> <span class="highlight">section</span> where all your published and unpublished <span class="highlight">data</span> came from, 'cause you have a lot of unpublished <span class="highlight">climate</span> <span class="highlight">data</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.24" data-time="111.34">[01:51.34]</span>Student: Hmm . . . something just came into my <span class="highlight">mind</span> and went out the other side.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="115.58">[01:55.58]</span>Professor: That happens to me a lot, so I've come up with a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> good memory <span class="highlight">management</span> tool. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="119.76">[01:59.76]</span>I carry a little pad with me all the time and <span class="highlight">jot</span> down questions or ideas that I don't want to forget. <span class="time" data-times="11.22" data-time="125.14">[02:05.14]</span>For example, I went to the doctor with my daughter and her baby son last week and we knew we wouldn't remember everything we <span class="highlight">wanted</span> to ask the doctor, so we actually made a <span class="highlight">list</span> of five things we <span class="highlight">wanted</span> answers to.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.82" data-time="136.36">[02:16.36]</span>Student: A notepad is a good idea. <span class="time" data-times="4.74" data-time="138.18">[02:18.18]</span>Since I'm so busy now at the end of the <span class="highlight">semester</span>, I'm getting <span class="highlight">pretty</span> forgetful these days. <span class="time" data-times="2.99" data-time="142.92">[02:22.92]</span>OK. I just remembered what I was trying to say before.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.03" data-time="145.91">[02:25.91]</span>Professor: Good. I was hoping you'd come up with it.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.66" data-time="147.94">[02:27.94]</span>Student: Yes. It ends up that I have <span class="highlight">data</span> on more than just the <span class="highlight">immediate</span> <span class="highlight">Grant</span> City area, so I also included some regional <span class="highlight">data</span> in the <span class="highlight">report</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.4" data-time="155.6">[02:35.60]</span>With everything else it should be a <span class="highlight">pretty</span> good indicator of the <span class="highlight">climate</span> in this part of the <span class="highlight">state</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="160">[02:40.00]</span>Professor: Sounds good. I'd be happy to look over a <span class="highlight">draft</span> <span class="highlight">version</span> before you hand in the final copy, if you wish.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.48" data-time="164.18">[02:44.18]</span>Student: Great. I'll plan to get you a <span class="highlight">draft</span> of the paper by next Friday. <span class="time" data-times="1.69" data-time="168.66">[02:48.66]</span>Thanks very much. <span class="time" data-times="1.5" data-time="170.35">[02:50.35]</span>Well, see ya.</p>
