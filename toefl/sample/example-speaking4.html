          <h4 class="w3-center">Animal Domestication</h4>
          <p>For thousands of years, humans have been able to domesticate, or tame, many large mammals that in the wild live together in herds. Once tamed, these mammals are used for agricultural work and transportation. Yet some herd mammals are not easily domesticated.</p>
          <p>A good indicator of an animal’s suitability for domestication is how protective the animal is of its territory. Nonterritorial animals are more easily domesticated than territorial animals because they can live close together with animals from other herds. A second indicator is that animals with a hierarchical social structure, in which herd members follow a leader, are easy to domesticate, since a human can function as the “leader.” </p>

          <p>So we've been discussing the suitability of animals for domestication . . . particularly animals that live together in herds. Now, if we take horses, for example . . . in the wild, horses live in herds that consist of one male and several females and their young. When a herd moves, the dominant male leads, with the dominant female and her young immediately behind him. The dominant female and her young are then followed immediately by the second most important female and her young, and so on. This is why domesticated horses can be harnessed one after the other in a row.</p>
          <p>They're “programmed” to follow the lead of another horse. On top of that, you often find different herds of horses in the wild occupying overlapping areas-they don't fight off other herds that enter the same territory. </p>
          <p>But it's exactly the opposite with an animal like the uh, the antelope . . . which . . . well, antelopes are herd animals too. But unlike horses, a male antelope will fight fiercely to prevent another male from entering its territory during the breeding season, OK-very different from the behavior of horses. Try keeping a couple of male antelopes together in a small space and see what happens. Also, antelopes don't have a social hierarchy-they don't instinctively follow any leader. That makes it harder for humans to control their behavior. </p>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p><b>Term:</b> Animal Domestication</p>
        <p><b>Reading Structure:</b> two characteristics of animal’s suitability for domestication. <b>1.</b> Non-territorial animals are more easily domesticated because they can live close together with animals from other herds. <b>2.</b> animals with a hierarchical social structure are easy to domesticate.</p>
        <p><b>Listening Structure:</b> the behavior of two species of animals. <b>1.</b> a familiar domesticated animal that has both of the characteristics and <b>2.</b> a common, undomesticated species that lacks these characteristics.</p>

          <p>Herd animals can be easily domesticated if they have a hierarchical social structure and are not territorial, and that this is why it is easier to domesticate horses than antelopes. Horses' hierarchical social structure makes them willing to follow one another and thus allows a human being to act as their leader. Because horses are not territorial, they can be harnessed together without fighting.  Unlike horses, male antelopes, which are territorial, fight if they are together, and that because antelopes do not have a social hierarchy, humans can’t control them by acting as their leader.</p>
