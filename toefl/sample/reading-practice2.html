            <h4 class="w3-center">Desert Formation</h4>
            <p>The deserts, which already <span class="highlight">occupy</span> <span class="highlight">approximately</span> a fourth of the Earth's land surface, have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace. The <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of desert-like conditions into areas where they did not <span class="highlight">previously</span> exist is called <span class="highlight">desertification</span>. It has been estimated that an <span class="highlight">additional</span> one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is <span class="highlight question1">threatened</span> by this <span class="highlight">process</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Desertification</span> is <span class="highlight">accomplished</span> <span class="highlight">primarily</span> <span class="highlight">through</span> the loss of stabilizing natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> and the <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> <span class="highlight">erosion</span> of the soil by wind and water. In some cases the <span class="highlight">loose</span> soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to form <span class="highlight">mobile</span> hills or ridges of sand.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Even</span> in the areas that <span class="highlight">retain</span> a soil cover, the <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> typically results in the loss of the soil's <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> <span class="highlight">substantial</span> quantities of water. The <span class="highlight">impact</span> of raindrops on the <span class="highlight">loose</span> soil tends to <span class="highlight">transfer</span> fine <span class="highlight">clay</span> particles into the tiniest soil spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water <span class="highlight">absorption</span> is greatly reduced; <span class="highlight">consequently</span> <span class="highlight">runoff</span> is increased, resulting in <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> <span class="highlight">erosion</span> rates. The <span class="highlight">gradual</span> drying of the soil caused by its <span class="highlight">diminished</span> <span class="highlight">ability</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> water results in the further loss of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, so that a <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">progressive</span> surface <span class="highlight">deterioration</span> is established.</p>
            <p>In some regions, the increase in <span class="highlight">desert</span> areas is occurring largely as the result of a <span class="highlight">trend</span> toward drier <span class="highlight">climatic</span> conditions. Continued <span class="highlight">gradual</span> global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years. The <span class="highlight">process</span> may be <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> in <span class="highlight">subsequent</span> decades if global warming resulting from <span class="highlight">air</span> pollution seriously increases.</p>
            <p>There is little <span class="highlight">doubt</span>, however, that <span class="highlight">desertification</span> in most areas results <span class="highlight">primarily</span> from human activities rather than natural processes. The <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> lands bordering the deserts exist in a <span class="highlight"><span class="question3">delicate</span></span> <span class="highlight">ecological</span> <span class="highlight">balance</span> and are limited in their <span class="highlight">potential</span> to <span class="highlight">adjust</span> to increased <span class="highlight">environmental</span> pressures. Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and <span class="highlight">fuel</span>. In wet periods, the land may be able to <span class="highlight">respond</span> to these stresses. During the dry periods that are <span class="highlight">common</span> phenomena <span class="highlight">along</span> the <span class="highlight">desert</span> margins, though, the <span class="highlight">pressure</span> on the land is often far in <span class="highlight">excess</span> of its <span class="highlight">diminished</span> <span class="highlight">capacity</span>, and <span class="highlight">desertification</span> results.</p>
            <p>Four <span class="highlight">specific</span> activities have been identified as <span class="highlight">major</span> contributors to the <span class="highlight">desertification</span> processes: overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation. The <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> of crops has expanded into <span class="question5">progressively</span> drier regions as <span class="highlight">population</span> densities have grown. These regions are especially likely to have periods of <span class="highlight">severe</span> dryness, so that crop failures are <span class="highlight">common</span>. Since the raising of most crops necessitates the <span class="highlight">prior</span> <span class="highlight">removal</span> of the natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, crop failures leave <span class="highlight">extensive</span> tracts of land <span class="question7"><span class="highlight">devoid</span> of</span> a plant cover and <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to wind and water <span class="highlight">erosion</span>.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A">
              </span>The raising of <span class="highlight">livestock</span> is a <span class="highlight">major</span> <span class="highlight">economic</span> <span class="highlight">activity</span> in <span class="highlight">semiarid</span> lands, where grasses are generally the <span class="highlight">dominant</span> type of natural <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>The consequences of an <span class="highlight">excessive</span> number of <span class="highlight">livestock</span> <span class="highlight">grazing</span> in an area are the <span class="highlight">reduction</span> of the <span class="highlight">vegetation</span> cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and <span class="highlight">accelerated</span> <span class="highlight">erosion</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p>
            <p>Firewood is the <span class="highlight">chief</span> <span class="highlight">fuel</span> used for cooking and heating in many countries. The increased pressures of expanding populations have led to the <span class="highlight">removal</span> of woody plants so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees and shrubs. The increasing use of dried animal <span class="highlight">waste</span> as a <span class="highlight">substitute</span> <span class="highlight">fuel</span> has also hurt the soil because this <span class="highlight">valuable</span> soil conditioner and <span class="highlight">source</span> of plant nutrients is no longer being returned to the land.</p>
            <p>The final <span class="highlight">major</span> human cause of <span class="highlight">desertification</span> is soil <span class="highlight">salinization</span> resulting from overirrigation. <span class="highlight">Excess</span> water from <span class="highlight">irrigation</span> sinks down into the water table. If no <span class="highlight">drainage</span> system exists, the water table rises, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. The water evaporates and the salts are left behind, creating a white <span class="highlight">crustal</span> <span class="highlight">layer</span> that prevents <span class="highlight">air</span> and water from reaching the <span class="highlight">underlying</span> soil.</p>
            <p>
              <span class="question10">The <span class="highlight">extreme</span> seriousness of <span class="highlight">desertification</span> results from the <span class="highlight">vast</span> areas of land and the <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or <span class="highlight">even</span> slowing the <span class="highlight">process</span>.</span> Once the soil has been removed by <span class="highlight">erosion</span>, only the <span class="highlight">passage</span> of centuries or <span class="highlight">millennia</span> will enable new soil to form. In areas where <span class="highlight">considerable</span> soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to <span class="highlight">reverse</span> the present <span class="highlight">deterioration</span> of the surface.</p>

                <p>2.  This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 3. The correct answer is choice 2, reduced water absorption. The paragraph explicitly states that the reduction of vegetation greatly reduces water absorption. Choice 4, reduced water runoff, explicitly contradicts the paragraph, so it is incorrect. The "spaces in the soil" are mentioned in another context: the paragraph does not say that they increase, so choice 3 is incorrect. The paragraph does not mention choice 1. </p>

The paragraph says that "expanding populations," or settlement, subject border areas to "pressures," or stress, that the land may not "be able to respond to." Choice 2 is incorrect because the paragraph does not discuss "fertility" after desertification. Choice 3 is also incorrect because "irrigation" is not mentioned here.

                <p>6.  This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 6. The correct answer is choice 3, "removal of the original vegetation." Sentence 4 of this paragraph says that "the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of the natural vegetation," an explicit statement of answer choice 3. Choice 1, lack of proper irrigation techniques, is incorrect because the paragraph mentions only "overirrigation" as a cause of desertification. No irrigation "techniques" are discussed. Choices 2 and 4, failure to plant suitable crops and use of animal waste, are not discussed. </p>

                <p>8.  This is a Factual Information question asking for specific information that can be found in paragraph 9. The correct answer is choice 4, "bring salts to the surface." The paragraph says that the final human cause of desertification is salinization resulting from overirrigation. The paragraph goes on to say that the overirrigation causes the water table to rise, bringing salts to the surface. There is no mention of the process "interfering" with or "limiting" irrigation, or of the "amount of air" the soil is required to absorb, so choices 1, 2, and 3 are all incorrect. </p>

Choice 1, "soil erosion," is explicitly mentioned in paragraph 2 as one of the primary causes of desertification, so it is not the correct answer. Choice 2, "global warming," is mentioned as a cause of desertification in paragraph 4, so it is incorrect. Choice 4, "raising of livestock," is described in paragraph 7 as another cause of desertification, so it is incorrect. The passage includes excessive irrigation as a cause of desertification, but not its opposite, insufficient irrigation, so that is the correct answer. </p>

                <p>11.  This is an Inference question asking for an inference that can be supported by the passage. The correct answer is choice 3; the passage suggests that the author believes "Desertification will continue to increase." The last paragraph of the passage says that slowing or reversing the erosion process will be very difficult, but that it may occur in those areas that are not too affected already if rigorously enforced anti-erosion processes are implemented. Taken together, this suggests that the author is not confident this will happen; therefore, it can be inferred that he thinks erosion will continue. The passage provides no basis for inferring choices 1, 2, or 4. </p>

The sentence provided, "This economic reliance on livestock in certain regions makes large tracts of land susceptible to overgrazing," is best inserted at Square 2. The inserted sentence refers explicitly to relying on "livestock in certain regions." Those regions are the ones described in the sentence preceding square 2, which states that raising livestock is "a major economic activity in semiarid lands." The inserted sentence then explains that this reliance "makes large tracts of land susceptible to overgrazing." The sentence that follows square 2 goes on to say that "The consequences of an excessive number of livestock grazing in an area are . . ." Thus, the inserted sentence contains references to both the sentence before square 2 and the sentence after square 2. This is not true of any of the other possible insert points, so square 2 is correct. </p>

                <p>13.    This is a Prose Summary question. It is completed correctly below. The correct choices are 1, 3, and 4. Choices 2, 5, and 6 are therefore incorrect. </p>
<p>Choice 1, "Growing human populations and the agricultural demands that come with such growth have upset the ecological balance in some areas and led to the spread of deserts," is correct because it is a recurring theme in the passage, one of the main ideas. Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, and 9 all provide details in support of this statement. </p>
<p>Choice 3, "Excessive numbers of cattle and the need for firewood for fuel have reduced grasses and trees, leaving the land unprotected and vulnerable," is correct because these are two of the human activities that are major causes of desertification. The causes of desertification is the main theme of the passage. Paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 are devoted to describing how these activities contribute to desertification. </p>
<p>Choice 4, "Extensive irrigation with poor drainage brings salt to the surface of the soil, a process that reduces water and air absorption," is correct because it is another of the human activities that is a major cause of desertification, the main theme of the passage. Paragraph 6 mentions this first, then all of paragraph 9 is devoted to describing how this activity contributes to desertification.</p>
<p>Choice 2, "As periods of severe dryness have become more common, failures of a number of different crops have increased," is incorrect because it is a supporting detail, not a main idea of the passage. </p>
<p>Choice 5, "Animal dung enriches the soil by providing nutrients for plant growth," is incorrect because it is contradicted by paragraph 8 of the passage. </p>
<p>Choice 6, "Grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation in semiarid lands," is incorrect because it is a minor detail, mentioned once in passing in paragraph 7.</p></div>
