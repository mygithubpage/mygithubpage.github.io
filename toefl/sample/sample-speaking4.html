          <h4 class="w3-center">Flow</h4>
          <p>In psychology, the feeling of complete and energized focus in an activity is called <span class="highlight">flow</span> . People who enter a state of flow lose their sense of time and have a feeling of great satisfaction. They become completely involved in an activity for its own sake rather than for what may result from the activity, such as money or prestige. Contrary to expectation, flow usually happens not during relaxing moments of leisure and entertainment, but when we are actively involved in a difficult enterprise, in a task that stretches our mental or physical abilities.</p>

          <p>(Male professor) I think this will help you get a picture of what your textbook is describing. I had a friend who taught in the physics department, Professor Jones, he retired last year. . . . Anyway, I remember . . . this was a few years ago . . . I remember passing by a classroom early one morning just as he was leaving, and he looked terrible: his clothes were all rumpled, and he looked like he hadn't slept all night. And I asked if he was OK. I was surprised when he said that he never felt better, that he was totally happy. He had spent the entire night in the classroom working on a mathematics puzzle. He didn't stop to eat dinner; he didn't stop to sleep . . . or even rest. He was that involved in solving the puzzle. And it didn't even have anything to do with his teaching or research; he had just come across this puzzle accidentally, I think in a mathematics journal, and it just really interested him, so he worked furiously all night and covered the blackboards in the classroom with equations and numbers and never realized that time was passing by.</p>

          <p>Passage is talking about general information about the flow and then the professor illustrates the example of that and he said he met the friend of a friend who teaches. Physics and 3 years ago he accidentally met the met his friend and he found that his friend was his friends close with were all jumbled and casting. And he he's okay he's under a different set. So concentrated on the mathematical puzzles that he he didn't sleep or rest in it and also he didn't actually eat and. Actually the he he thinks that his friend came across to the magnetic puzzle and. He couldn't realize that the time was passing by and his friend actually was in the flow.</p>

            <h5>Comment</h5>
            <p>This response meets the criteria at score level 3. In this response, the speaker demonstrates quite good use of vocabulary and grammar. His speech is generally very clear, he has good pronunciation, and he uses intonation effectively. The pacing of speech is often very good as well, although at times the speech is rather choppy and marked by frequent hesitations. The speaker gives an accurate summary of the example the professor discusses, but he does not address the concept of flow in general terms or discuss the main features of the phenomenon—that is, <b>total focus on a task, losing track of time, a feeling of satisfaction, and/or completing a task for its own sake rather than for a reward</b>. For this reason, the speaker’s response—in spite of containing a good summary of the example—does not completely fulfill the task, which is not just to describe the example but, rather, to explain how the example illustrates the concept.</p>

          <p>Flow means the feeling of complete and energize focus in an activity. The professor use his own experience to demonstrate the term. One morning he met his friend who is physics teacher. his looks terrible. The professor ask his friend whether he is ok. To the professor's surprised his told him he never felt that better. He encounter a math problem accidentally and this problem has nothing to do with his teaching career. His friend was so interested in the puzzle that he forgot to eat, sleep or even rest. He was that involved that he never realize the time had passing by.</p>
