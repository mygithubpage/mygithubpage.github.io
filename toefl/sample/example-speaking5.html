          <p>Man: Hey Lisa, how's it going? </p>
          <p>Woman: Hi Mark. Uh, I'm OK, I guess, but my schoolwork is really stressing me out. </p>
          <p>Man[sympathetically] Yeah? What's wrong? </p>
          <p>Woman: Well, I've got a paper to write and two exams to study for. And a bunch of math problems to finish. It's just so much that I can't concentrate on any of it. I start concentrating on studying for one of my exams, and then I'm like, how long's it gonna take to finish that problem set? </p>
          <p>Man: Wow. Sounds like you've got a lot more work than you can handle right now. [Not wanting to sound too pushy]Look, have you talked to some of your professors . . . mean, you know, try to explain the problem. Look, you could probably get an extension on your paper, or on the math assignment . . . </p>
          <p>Woman: You think? It would give me a little more time to prepare for my exams right now. </p>
          <p>Man: Well, I mean another thing that you might do . . . I mean have you tried making yourself a schedule? I mean that's what I do when I'm feeling overwhelmed. </p>
          <p>Woman: What does that do for you? </p>
          <p>Man: Well, I mean it helps you to focus your energies. You know, you make yourself a chart that shows the next few days and the time till your stuff is due and . . . </p>
          <p>Woman: Uh-huh . . . [meaning “I'm listening”]</p>
          <p>Man: I mean think about what you need to do and when you have to do it by. You know then start filling in your schedule—like, all right 9:00 [nine] to 11:30 [eleven-thirty] A.M., study for exam. 12:00 [twelve] to 3:00 [three], work on problem set. But I mean don't make the time periods too long. Like, don't put in eight hours of studying—you know, you'll get tired, or start worrying about your other work again. But if you keep to your schedule, you know you'll just have to worry about one thing at a time. </p>
          <p>Woman: Yeah, that might work. [somewhat noncommittally]</p>

        <p>The students discuss two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Describe the problem. Then state which of the two solutions you prefer and explain why. </p>

          <p>I think it would be better if the woman prepared a schedule. The problem of too much work to do is something that the woman is going to confront in the future as well. If she learns how to organize a schedule now, this will help her throughout her academic career. Even though her professors might be willing to give her an extension, they might somehow penalize her for it by grading her assignments more severely.</p>
