              <p>And Ceres was in the right place-the missing spot. When the accuracy of Bird's law was verified, people at the time were keen to find planets in the vacant place, but they found a group of faint asteroids represented by Ceres. Asteroid belt.</p>

              <p>Um, well, this pattern is known as Bode's Law. Um, it isn't really a scientific law, not in the sense of prediction of gravitation mathematically or something, but it's attempting a pattern in the spacing of the planets, and it was noticed By Bode hundreds of years ago. The prediction of the planet by Polder's law is only a rough prediction, not a theory that actually picks up the calculator to make precise calculations. So it's not really a scientific law</p>
