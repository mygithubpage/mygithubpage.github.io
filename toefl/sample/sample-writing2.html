        <p>I remember every teacher that has taught me since I was in Kindergarten. If a friend wants to know who our first grade teacher was in elementary school, all they have to do is ask me. The teachers all looked very kind and understanding in my eyes as a child. They had special relationships with nearly each and every one of the students and were very nice to everyone. That's the reason I remember all of them.</p>
        <p>A teacher's primary goal is to teach students the best they can about the things that are in our textbooks and more important, how to show respect for one another. They teach us how to live a better life by getting along with everyone. In order to do that, the teachers themselves have to be able to relate well with students.</p>
        <p>My parents are teachers too. One teaches Plant Biology and one teaches English, but that's not the reason I'm calling them "teachers." They are teachers beacuse they teach me how to act in special situations and how to cooperate with others. I have a brother, and my parents use different aproaches when teaching us. They might scold my brother for surfing the internet too long because he doesn't have much self-control and they need to restrain him. He almost never studies on his own and is always either drawing, playing computer games, or reading. On the other hand, they never tell me off for using the computer too long.  I do my own work when I want and need to because that brings me the best results and my parents understand that. They know that I need leisure time of my own and that I'll only play until needed. My parents' ability to relate well with my brother and I allows them to teach, not just the subject they teach but also their excellent knowledge on life.</p>
        <p>Knowlegde of the subject being taught is something taken for granted, but at the same time, secondary. One must go through and pass a series of courses and tests in order to become a teacher. Any teacher is able to have excellent knowledge of their subject but not all teachers can have the ability to relate well with students.</p>
        <p>A teacher's primary goal is to teach students the best they can about  how to show respect for one another, so teachers use different approaches when teaching, and knowledge of the subjet being taught is secondary. For these reasons, I claim with confidence that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is secondary to the teacher's ability to relate well with their students.</p>
        
        <h5>Comments</h5>
        <p>This essay conveys the idea that as important as teaching knowledge is, it is as important if not more important for teachers to possess other qualities, all of which the writer classifies as necessary for being able to relate well with students. Those other qualities include having special relationships with students; the teaching of respect (in the first two paragraphs); and taking different approaches for different individuals. The writer develops the last idea primarily by using a clearly appropriate extended and complex example of the writers own parents, who are teachers but whose special qualities in raising the writer and the writers brother had to do more with taking varied approaches. The writer then goes on to convey that knowledge is a givensomething taken for grantedbecause all teachers take course work and pass tests to gain their jobs but not all have the qualities the writer considers more important.</p>
        <p>This response very effectively addresses the topic and the task. It is true that this response is different from most essays: the overall idea is stated explicitly but only at the end of the essay. However, because of very good language structure and good conceptual transitions between ideas, the reader is able to follow the writers development of ideas without becoming confused. The response is thus seen to be well organized. Errors in language are almost nonexistent here. This response meets all of the 5-level criteria from the Scoring Guide.</p>

        <p>I disagree with the idea that the possessing the ability to relate well with student is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught for a teacher. There are several reasons why I disagree with that idea.</p>
        <p>First, teachers' job is to educate their student with their knowledge. The ability to relate well with their student is something a counselor should possess, not a teacher. That's why the board of education gives an award to a teacher with an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach.  Teachers who can get along with their students but have no knowledge can be popular and be liked by his or her students, however I don't consider a teacher with no knowledge a good teacher.</p>
        <p>Second, Students go to schools because they want to learn knowledge from their teachers not to get along with their teachers. I knew a math teacher who was well known among other mathematics teachers. Some students always complained how he never entertains his students which made many of his students to fall asleep. Nevertheless, all of his classes were all full even before the semester began because many students who were eager to learn already booked in. He won the Apples prize (it's given to a noticed teacher annually) a couple of times and that enabled students to firmly believe in his way of teaching.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, teachers are responsible for conceding their knowledge to their next generation. Teachers already had an experience of getting advantaged education from college. Teachers  should not let that previlege become useless and workless. We all learn because we want to become the better person that this world needs. Students will also eventually grow up to be influencing other people and teachers should volunteerily be their students' role models.</p>
        <p>For conclusion, I think the most important quality a teacher must have is an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach, not an ability to relate well with their students.</p>
        
        <h5>Comments</h5>
        <p>This is a more traditional-looking essay that is organized with a point of view in the first paragraph stating the writers disagreement with the writing prompt, followed by three pieces of supporting reasons and examples.</p>
        <p>The second paragraph makes the point that counselors are the ones who are supposed to relate to students and that teachers with no knowledge are not worthwhile as teachers.</p>
        <p>In the third paragraph the writer tries to describe the fact that knowledge is important by stating that students wanted to take courses from a teacher who was known to possess special knowledge even though they knew the teacher was not entertaining.</p>
        <p>The fourth paragraph contains the very interesting idea that teachers have the obligation to pass on what they have had the privilege of learning, but this paragraph in particular has a few problems with somewhat unclear expression of concepts: (1) errors of word choice in the word conceding (not clear exactly what word is intended here) and in the term advantaged education (advanced education or advantages of education?) and (2) a problem with unclear connection of ideas (why is it said that We all learn because we want to become the better person that this world needs?).</p>
        <p>Overall, this essay is well organized, but the slightly unclear connection of ideas and the language chosen, especially in the final paragraph, prevent this response from rising above the 4 level.</p>
