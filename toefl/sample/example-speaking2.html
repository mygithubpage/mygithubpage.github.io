        <h4>Important Points</h4>
        <p>For example, if the position you take is that it is better for students to <u>study alone</u>, you might say that when students meet to study in groups, they often <b>waste time discussing matters that have nothing to do with their class work</b>. You might continue this explanation by <b>contrasting the inefficiency of studying in a group</b> with <b>the kind of productivity a student can achieve when studying alone</b>.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps you want to take the opposite position, that it is better for students to <u>study in groups</u>. In that case, you would explain the advantages of group study and the disadvantages of studying alone. Perhaps you think that the <b>more capable students can help the less capable students when students study together</b>. Or perhaps you have found that students who study in groups often <b>share each others' lecture notes</b>, and this way they can make sure <b>everyone understands all the material that has been covered in a course</b>.</p>
