Recent fossil evidence connecting whales and the hippopotamus.</p><p>B. Difficulties in the determining the evolutionary history of whales.</p><p>C. Similarities among ancient ancestors of whales.</p><p>D. Similarities between whales and other modern-day animals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor said We know whales are mammals and that they evolved from land creatures. So the mystery is figuring out how they became ocean dwellers. And then the whole piece talks about changing the whales from terrestrial animals to marine animals. The study of the process and the problems encountered have confirmed that the history of the development of whales is difficult to obtain the precise conclusion of the subject. So the answer should be B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what three aspects of the Ambulocetus fossil make Ambulocetus a likely bridge between land mammals and sea mammals?Click on 3 answers.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It had an elongated skeletal structure.</p><p>B. It strongly resembled a modern hippopotamus.</p><p>C. It had an unusually kind and thin tail for a whale.</p><p>D. It had limbs that could have been used for walking</p><p>E. Its skull had ear bones characteristic of land mammals</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="ACD"><p>The professor first of all told everyone that the name Ambulocetus means walking whale that swims, suggesting that there may be a telling correlation between Ambulocetus and the whale, and then mentioning that some positive Ambulocetus may be a transition between whale and terrestrial mammals. Characteristics: It clearly had four limbs that couldn't have been used for walking, that is, answer D; It also had a long thin tail, typical of mammals, something we don't see in today's whales, ie answer C; it also had a long skeletal structure, the answer A.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor ,what does the discovery of Ambulocetus mean to researchers?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It fills a gap in the fossil evidence for whale evolution.</p><p>B. It has become less significant since the discovery of Basilosaurus.</p><p>C. It call into doubt the theory that whale evolved from land mammals.</p><p>D. It suggests that whales evolved more recently than was previously believed.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The auditory material analyzes the body structure of Ambulocetus and explains why these structural features prove that Ambulocetus is a transition between whale and terrestrial mammals, suggesting that the discovery of Ambulocetus filled some gaps in this transition period. B, C, D are not mentioned in the material.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What evidence suggests that whale are descendants of the hippopotamus?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Similarities between hippopotamus fossils and the Ambulocetus fossil.</p><p>B. Similarities in the genes of hippopotamuses and whales.</p><p>C. Similarities in the habitats of modern hippopotamuses and ancient whales.</p><p>D. Similarities in the skeletal structures of modern hippopotamuses and ancient whales.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Hearing material mentions that by comparing the DNA of whale and hippopotamuses, it is concluded that the whale is a descendant of hippopotamuses. This conclusion is based on the similarity between DNA of whale and hippopotamuses. So the answer should be B.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about recent genetic studies relating to whale evolution?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They solve a long-standing mystery involving fossil evidence.</p><p>B. They contain significant errors.</p><p>C. They present evidence that conflicts with fossil evidence.</p><p>D. The findings of the various studies should not have surprised researchers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor said that through analysis of fossils (that is, body structure) and through DNA analysis we obtained contradictory evidences, We can believe the molecular data- the DNA, or we can believe the skeleton trail, but unfortunately, not both. So the answer should be C.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does DNA evidence indicate about relationships among whales?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. All modern whales descend from sperm whales.</p><p>B. Differences among toothed whales are less significant that was previously thought.</p><p>C. Not all toothed whales are closely related.</p><p>D. Sperm whale are more closely related to killer whales than was previously thought.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor mentioned that the toothless whales, like the blue whale and other baleen whales, we proved that they be closely related. But recent DNA studies suggest that that's not the case at all. The toothless whales are not necessarily similar in DNA. . So the answer should be C</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
