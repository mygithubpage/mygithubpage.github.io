            <span class="time" data-times="10.5" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">Marine</span> <span class="highlight">Biology</span> Class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="10.5">[00:10.50]</span>Professor: We know whales are mammals and that they evolved from land creatures. <span class="time" data-times="4.91" data-time="15.54">[00:15.54]</span>So the mystery is figuring out how they became ocean dwellers. <span class="time" data-times="11.92" data-time="20.45">[00:20.45]</span>Because until recently there was no <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="highlight">record</span> of what we call "the missing link" – that is <span class="highlight">evidence</span> of <span class="highlight">species</span> that show the <span class="highlight">transition</span> between land-dwelling mammals and today's whales. <span class="time" data-times="5.79" data-time="32.37">[00:32.37]</span>Fortunately, some recent <span class="highlight">fossil</span> discoveries have made the picture a little bit clearer.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.54" data-time="38.16">[00:38.16]</span>For example, a few years back in Pakistan, they found the <span class="highlight">skull</span> of a wolf-like creature. <span class="time" data-times="2.24" data-time="44.7">[00:44.70]</span>It was about 50 million years old. <span class="time" data-times="5.55" data-time="46.94">[00:46.94]</span>Scientists had seen this wolf-like creature before, but this <span class="highlight">skull</span> was different. <span class="time" data-times="7.51" data-time="52.49">[00:52.49]</span>The ear area of the <span class="highlight">skull</span> had characteristics seen only in <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> mammals, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> whales.<span class="time" data-times="10.14" data-time="60">[01:00.00]</span>Uh, well, then also in Pakistan, they found a <span class="highlight">fossil</span> of another creature, which we call Ambulocetus Natans.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="70.14">[01:10.14]</span>That's a mouthful, eh? <span class="time" data-times="8.42" data-time="73.06">[01:13.06]</span>The name Ambulocetus natans comes from <span class="highlight">Latin</span> of <span class="highlight">course</span>, and means "walking whale that swims". <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="81.48">[01:21.48]</span>It clearly had four limbs that could have been used for walking. <span class="time" data-times="7.08" data-time="85.84">[01:25.84]</span>It also had a long thin tail, <span class="highlight">typical</span> of mammals, something we don't see in today's whales. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="92.92">[01:32.92]</span>But, it also had a long <span class="highlight">skeletal</span> structure. <span class="time" data-times="4.87" data-time="96.82">[01:36.82]</span>And that long <span class="highlight">skeletal</span> structure suggests that it was <span class="highlight">aquatic</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="101.69">[01:41.69]</span>And very recently in Egypt, they found a <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> of Basilosaurus. <span class="time" data-times="5.61" data-time="108.68">[01:48.68]</span>Basilosaurus was a creature that we had already known about for over a hundred years. <span class="time" data-times="4.65" data-time="114.29">[01:54.29]</span>And it has been linked to modern whales because of its long whale-like body. <span class="time" data-times="6.68" data-time="118.94">[01:58.94]</span>But this new <span class="highlight">fossil</span> find showed a full set of leg bones, something we didn't have before.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="125.62">[02:05.62]</span>The legs were too small to be useful. <span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="127.92">[02:07.92]</span>They weren't <span class="highlight">even</span> connected to its <span class="highlight">pelvis</span> and couldn't have supported its weight. <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="132.21">[02:12.21]</span>But it clearly shows Basilosaurus's <span class="highlight">evolution</span> from land creatures. <span class="time" data-times="2.71" data-time="136.52">[02:16.52]</span>So that's a <span class="highlight">giant</span> step in the right direction. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="139.23">[02:19.23]</span> <span class="highlight">Even</span> better, it establishes Ambulocetus as a <span class="highlight">clear</span> link between the wolf-like creature and Basilosaurus.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.93" data-time="146.81">[02:26.81]</span>Now these discoveries don't completely solve the mystery. <span class="time" data-times="6.46" data-time="150.74">[02:30.74]</span>I mean, Ambulocetus is a <span class="highlight">mammal</span> that shows a <span class="highlight">sort</span> of bridge between walking on land and swimming. <span class="time" data-times="3.9" data-time="157.2">[02:37.20]</span>But it also is very different from the whales who know today. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="161.1">[02:41.10]</span>So really we are working with just a few pieces of a big <span class="highlight">puzzle</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.37" data-time="167.01">[02:47.01]</span>Um...a related <span class="highlight">debate</span> involved some recent DNA studies. <span class="time" data-times="3.44" data-time="173.38">[02:53.38]</span>Remember, DNA is the <span class="highlight">genetic</span> <span class="highlight">code</span> for any <span class="highlight">organism</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.53" data-time="176.82">[02:56.82]</span>And when the DNA from two different <span class="highlight">species</span> is <span class="highlight">similar</span>, it suggests that those two <span class="highlight">species</span> are related. <span class="time" data-times="7.53" data-time="183.35">[03:03.35]</span>And when we compared some whale DNA with DNA from some other <span class="highlight">species</span>, we got quite a surprise. <span class="time" data-times="4.96" data-time="190.88">[03:10.88]</span>The DNA suggests that whales are descendants of the <span class="highlight">hippopotamus</span>. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="195.84">[03:15.84]</span>Yes, the <span class="highlight">hippopotamus</span>!</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.68" data-time="197.56">[03:17.56]</span>Well, it came as a bit of a shock. <span class="time" data-times="9.45" data-time="199.24">[03:19.24]</span>I mean, that a four-legged land and river <span class="highlight">dweller</span> could be the <span class="highlight">evolutionary</span> <span class="highlight">source</span> of a completely <span class="highlight">aquatic</span> creature up to 25 times its size? <span class="time" data-times="13.12" data-time="208.69">[03:28.69]</span> <span class="highlight">Unfortunately</span>, this revelation about the <span class="highlight">hippopotamus</span> apparently contradicts the <span class="highlight">fossil</span> <span class="highlight">record</span>, which suggests that the <span class="highlight">hippopotamus</span> is only a very <span class="highlight">distant</span> <span class="highlight">relative</span> of the whale, not an <span class="highlight">ancestor</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="221.81">[03:41.81]</span>And of <span class="highlight">course</span> as I mentioned, that whales are descended not from hippos but from that <span class="highlight">distant</span> wolf-like creature.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.86" data-time="228.77">[03:48.77]</span>So we have <span class="highlight">contradictory</span> <span class="highlight">evidence</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.07" data-time="231.63">[03:51.63]</span>And more research might just <span class="highlight">raise</span> more questions and create more controversies. <span class="time" data-times="2.02" data-time="236.7">[03:56.70]</span>At any <span class="highlight">rate</span>, we have a choice. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="238.72">[03:58.72]</span>We can believe the molecular <span class="highlight">data</span>, the DNA, or we can believe the <span class="highlight">skeleton</span> <span class="highlight">trail</span>, but <span class="highlight">unfortunately</span>, probably not both.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.39" data-time="248.49">[04:08.49]</span>Um... and there have been some other interesting findings from DNA research. <span class="time" data-times="8.57" data-time="254.88">[04:14.88]</span>For a long time, we assumed that all whales that had teeth including <span class="highlight">sperm</span> whales and killer whales were closely related to one another. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="263.45">[04:23.45]</span>And the same for the toothless whales, like the blue whale and other baleen whales, we assumed that they be closely related.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="271.13">[04:31.13]</span>But recent DNA studies suggest that that's not the case at all. <span class="time" data-times="7.58" data-time="274.99">[04:34.99]</span>The <span class="highlight">sperm</span> whale is actually closely related to the baleen whale, and it's only distantly related to the toothed-whales. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="282.57">[04:42.57]</span>So that was a real surprise to all of us.</p>

              <p>The professor said We know whales are mammals and that they evolved from land creatures. So the mystery is figuring out how they became ocean dwellers. And then the whole piece talks about changing the whales from terrestrial animals to marine animals. The study of the process and the problems encountered have confirmed that the history of the development of whales is difficult to obtain the precise conclusion of the subject. So the answer should be B.</p>

              <p>The professor first of all told everyone that the name Ambulocetus means walking whale that swims, suggesting that there may be a telling correlation between Ambulocetus and the whale, and then mentioning that some positive Ambulocetus may be a transition between whale and terrestrial mammals. Characteristics: It clearly had four limbs that couldn't have been used for walking, that is, answer D; It also had a long thin tail, typical of mammals, something we don't see in today's whales, ie answer C; it also had a long skeletal structure, the answer A.</p>

              <p>The professor said that through analysis of fossils (that is, body structure) and through DNA analysis we obtained contradictory evidences, We can believe the molecular data- the DNA, or we can believe the skeleton trail, but unfortunately, not both. So the answer should be C.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
              <p>The professor mentioned that the toothless whales, like the blue whale and other baleen whales, we proved that they be closely related. But recent DNA studies suggest that that's not the case at all. The toothless whales are not necessarily similar in DNA. . So the answer should be C</p>
