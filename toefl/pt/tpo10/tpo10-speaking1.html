Why did you think you could not do it?</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>When answering this question, you could talk about topics such as an award you received or an activity you completed successfully. Describe the activity or award and then explain why you believed it would not be possible. You may choose to talk about any type of accomplishment, major or minor.

I got 8.5 in Listening section which is almost the full mark,9. Originally, I didn't think I could get above 7 because I couldn't really follow the speakers' speed and my vocabulary wasn't big. So I wasn't confident. But I knew that my weak point was in listening section, so I listened to the IELTS recordings whenever I had time. When I was walking along the street, I listened to the recordings. When I was relaxing, I listened to the recordings. When I was taking a nap, I listened to the recordings. Besides, I bought a book to enlarge my vocabulary. I think it were these efforts I paid that helped me get 8.5.</p></article></div><div><p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 5.</b></p><p><audio src="track_53.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker clearly explains what the accomplishment was (transitioning from dentistry into banking) and why he thought he wouldn't be able to do it (he lacked knowledge, he had insecurity). Although this is not specifically required by the prompt, he explained how he overcame the obstacles, through additional training and rehearsing. His ideas are well connected and easy to follow: When I had to change my profession from dentistry to banking thought I would not be able to sell any banking product because I lacked the knowledge of . . . but L . . 7 He also uses intonation and pauses effectively, pausing or using emphasis in ways that help the listener understand the structure and tone of the sentences. Although he makes occasional errors in grammar ("I thought I will not be able to. . 7) or usage ("I tried to put down everything I learned"), in general he is able to use complex structures ("because I lacked the knowledge of the more senior banking associates", "when I had to change my profession from dentistry to banking") with ease and accuracy.</p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 54.</b></p><p><audio src="track_54.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker communicates the accomplishment (doing well on a test) and why he thought he wouldn't be able to do it (he doesn't have self-confidence), but his response is not as detailed or well organized as high-level responses. The description of the accomplishment is rather vague ("a very good thing which is a challenge . . . consisting on a test"), and his explanation of why he thought he wouldn't be able to accomplish the task is limited and somewhat repetitive. The speaker is not able to successfully use more complex grammar and sophisticated vocabulary to elaborate on his ideas. Grammatical errors and incorrect word choice also cause slight misunderstandings at times. To score at a higher level, the speaker would need to clearly explain what the test was and why exactly he wasn't confident he would do well on this particular test.</p></div></main></body></html>
