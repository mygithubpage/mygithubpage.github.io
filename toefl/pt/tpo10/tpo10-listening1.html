              <p>The professor told the students that when they were creating in school, they had to remember to follow their own ideas, and in the social creation, that could be in different story, that is, the situation was different. There are a lot of pressures to become something you are not, and people often surrendered to that pressure. In the creation of society, people may deliberately pursue fashion trends because of various pressures, hoping to get approval from others. So the answer is the C option.</p>
