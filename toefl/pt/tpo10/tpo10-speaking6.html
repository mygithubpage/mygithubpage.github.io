However, some new research's suggesting that babies may be able to feel concern for others, to have empathy for others.Now, empathy is a complex emotion. It involves a baby relating to someone else's emotions, not just reacting to things happening directly to them. Let's talk about an experiment that may show that babies could be capable of feeling empathy.Ok, for the first part of the experiment, well, um, we've always known that babies start to cry when they hear other babies crying, right? One baby in a room starts crying and all the rest join in. We've always assumed that the other babies cry because they were reacting to the noise of crying, that the noise itself was distressing. So, in the experiment researchers play tape recording, a tape of baby's crying, to another baby. And sure enough, the baby started crying when he heard the sound of other baby's crying. This was no surprise, of course. An d the researchers assumed that the baby cried because of the noise. But the next part of the experiment was surprising. The researchers played the baby a tape of his own crying. Now it was just as noisy, so the researchers expected him to cry. However, this time the baby did not cry. He wasn't upset b y the sound of his own crying. Why not? Well, maybe it wasn't the noise that made him cry before when he heard other baby's crying.In fact, maybe noise has nothing to do with it. It could be that the baby felt empathy for the other babies. And that was why he got upset when he heard them crying. Researchers concluded that it is indeed possible that babies feel empathy, concern for others."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the points from the lecture explain why researchers think that babies may feel empathy. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>In this item, your summary of the key ideas from the lecture should include that researchers believe that babies are capable of feeling empathy. They think this because they did an experiment where a baby listened to other babies crying. The baby cried when he heard the other babies crying (which is what they expected). However, when the researchers played the baby a tape of his own crying, he didn't cry. This told researchers that noise wasn't the cause of the crying. Rather, it suggested that the baby cried because he felt empathy or concern for the other babies. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Babies were assumed to react only to themselves, but there're experiments that show that babies actually have emotion of higher level, that is empathy, which means they can relate and react to the feelings of the others. In the first part of the experiment, the researcher played to the baby some other babies' cry, and the baby cried when it heard the recording. So at this stage, the researchers assumed that baby cried because of the noise, which was distressing itself. However, they realized later that they were wrong when they did the second part of the experiment, in which they played the tape of the baby's own cry and surprisingly found that the baby didn't cry. The second part of the experiment suggests that the baby was probably not upset by the noise of cry as it didn't cry for his own cry, but that it felt the empathy for the babies whose cry was recorded in the tape.

She doesn't say explicitly that the researchers played a recording or tape of babies crying, and she also mispronounces the word "experiment." These are minor errors, however, and do not prevent the listener from understanding what happened in the experiment. One of the speaker's particular strengths is that she places emphasis on certain words to help communicate the difference between the two parts of the experiment ("... it's not the actual noise that triggers the baby's reflex to cry, but actually an emotional feeling"). </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 64.</b></p><p><audio src="track_64.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>In this response, the speaker gives a basic summary of both parts of the experiment. Her pronunciation is also quite clear. However, she hesitates often while searching for words to describe what happened in the experiment. These pauses and the limits in her vocabulary prevent her from making the final connection and explaining why the results of the experiment led researchers to believe that babies feel empathy. The point isn't, as the speaker says, that babies can "differentiate" between their own cries and those of other babies. The point is that the baby only cried when he heard the other babies cry, which made researchers think that noise wasn't an issue, but rather that he felt concern for the other babies. Overall, the response is slightly confusing to the listener because of these missing pieces and lack of organization. </p></div></main></body></html>
