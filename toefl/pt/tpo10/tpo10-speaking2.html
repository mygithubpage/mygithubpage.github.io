          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>In this question, you need to say whether you think family members or friends are the most important influence on young adults. Then you must explain why this is your preference. You should try to explain it fully; you should not just give a list of reasons. Instead, you should try to pick one or two reasons and explain your opinion in more detail. Add examples when appropriate. If you think family members are the most important influence, for example, you could explain by discussing reasons such as the amount of time young adults spend with family versus friends, which gives family members more opportunities to influence them.</p>
          <P>Sometimes test-takers would like to choose both options, saying, for example, that one might be more true in some circumstances and the other true in different circumstances. This approach is acceptable; however, it is difficult to then fully explain your opinion if you choose both options, and it might lower your score if you don't finish or don't sufficiently support both choices during your response time. Only very fluent speakers should use the approach of choosing both options.</P>

          <p>When you answer this question, you should take a stance and state whether you agree or disagree that all children should be required to learn a second language in school. In order to support your opinion, you should provide at least one specific reason why children should or shouldn't be required to learn a second language, along with information to elaborate on and explain that reason. It is acceptable to talk about more than one reason for agreeing or disagreeing with the statement, but you should not simply provide a list of reasons without any explanation of them. </p>

          <p>In this response, the speaker states his agreement with the statement but does not provide full support for his opinion. Rather than choosing one or two reasons and explaining them in detail (using a personal experience, hypothetical situation, etc.), he lists many different and somewhat vague reasons but does not provide explanations for them: "because it helps really to uh thinks about other stuff"; "you're just smarter and you can just have better job"; it's really hard to learn second language." The speaker has mostly clear pronunciation and uses some sophisticated grammatical structures ("not only the language but also other cultures"), but his vague explanations make it somewhat difficult for a listener to follow his response. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>I don't think all children should be required to learn a second language in school. Some children don't even like to learn language. They are more interested in playing basketball, football and other sports. Even if they are required to learn a second language, they won't treat it seriously. I had many friends in junior high who didn't learn language at all. But they could play basketball very well and maybe some of them can become professional players. There is no need to learn a second language to achieve their goal. Also, many of the children won't have chance to use the second language they learned at school, because when they grow up their job doesn't need any foreign language skills. For example, many of my high school classmates now work as clerks in banks and they don't need to use foreign language in their work. Still, they can do just fine.</p>
