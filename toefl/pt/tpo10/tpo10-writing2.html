As a result, many computer games are available for children in recent years. Many people are concerned about this fact and they believe playing computer games is a waste of time. However, I couldn't disagree with this view of point more since I believe playing computer games could somehow benefit children.</p><p>First off, playing computer games offers children another way to meet more people and gain communication ability. Nowadays many computer games, such as World of War craft, need cooperation among lots of people. Children who involved in such kind of games have extra access to gaining social abilities. They can learn how to communicate efficiently with each other while playing.</p><p>Furthermore, playing computer games could help to improve children's intelligence. This means that children who play games may be cleverer than their peers and can learn more things without suffer. Many games available today, such as Angry Birds, really need some knowledge and deep thought so that you could complete the tasks.  Under this circumstance, children can be better at solving problems and smarter in the future.</p><p>What's more, computer games can be a very good way for relaxation. Children is modern society usually have more pressure and are more burdensome. By playing computer games, they can forget their worries and relax themselves. Their mind will be refreshed and they may be better at their work.</p><p>However, I have to admit that some children are just addicted to computer games and they waste their entire time sitting in front of the computers. In addition, there are many computer games which contain lots of violent scene which is harmful to children. Anyway, these problems can be solved by letting parents to supervise their children about what is the proper game to play.</p><p>All in all, I draw the conclusion that computer games can benefit children by offering opportunities to gain social abilities, improving intelligence and relaxing. Computer games are good things to enrich a child's life rather than ruin it.</p></article></article></div><article><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I disagree with statement that children should not be allowed to play computer games; it is not a waste of time. Lots of new skills and ideas can be developed through games and children should be encouraged to play games throughout their life. These days computer games can really enhance learning, help the development of manual and physical skills and even promote bonding people together. </p><p>I see computer games as new tools of learning for children. With development of computer games industry, more and more games are focused on mental development of children. Through computer games children can learn new languages by using games that understand and produce voice and text. And most importantly, they can interact with the computer game at their convinience at home. Therefore they can spend a lot more time using and developing language skills through computer games than just learning them during school time. </p><p>Computer and tablet games can also be very helpfull for learning math and algebra. There are many math games for preschoolers that capture kids' attentions because they are very attractive using sound and graphics and never get tired of teaching. And then there're higher level stand alone games and websites that have games that help students to absorb much more complex ideas like algebra and geometry, in a fun way.</p><p>Another good thing about some games is they can be used to develop manual and physical skills for children. By using different computer equipment and game programs, children can learn to, for example, drive a vehicle or even fly a plane. Other games and advance equipment let children practice sport moves just like they were playing sport for real. So these games can help develop movement, coordination, and ability to see and react to things in motion. </p><p>And finally, children can play games online in real time with chat. They can do this with other children located at a distance in their country or even anywhere in the world. As they play these online games with chat, they can talk to each other about almost anything. This can lead them to develop new kinds of friendships and international understanding and make their existing relations stronger.</p><p>Of course as in everthing, games should have their limits. But from all I have argued above, computer games are and should be part of children's daily life. </p><h5>Rater Comments</h5><p>This 5-level response disagrees with the statement. <b>1.2.</b> The writer talks about ways in which computer games are valuable, providing two nicely developed examples of games that enhance learning (language and math). <b>3.</b> The response also shows how games can promote development of motor skills and <b>4.</b> how some games, via chat and online connection, can promote friendship and international understanding. In the last paragraph, the writer mentions that games should have their limits, but then does not elaborate on this remark. This is an acceptable strategy for ending this response, which overall is a well-developed explanation of the value of computer games. </p></article></main></body></html>
