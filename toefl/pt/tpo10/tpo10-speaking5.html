        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Listen to a conversation between two students.</p>
          <p>(woman) Is there a problem with the electricity?</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, this storm knocked out power all over the city. And they're saying it might be several hours before we have electricity again.</p>
          <p>(woman) Oh, no! I have a history paper due tomorrow and I've been writing it on my lap top computer and the battery's running low. I am going to need electricity soon.</p>
          <p>(man) Well, you know, Jefferson City still has electricity. And there's a library there where you can plug in lap top. You could go over there to work on your paper. It's only about a twenty-minute drive.</p>
          <p>(woman) That's a good idea. Of course I'd have to pack up all my stuff and it is raining outside.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, that's true. Well, why don't you just ask the professor for an extension? You know, tomorrow when you go to class just ask him if he would give you an extra day to get the paper done. I'm pretty sure he'd agree. You know, with the storm and all.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, that should be a lot easier. But then he did tell us when he gave us the assignment that he wouldn't grant any extension.</p>
          <p>(man) You don't think he'd grant an exception in this case?</p>
          <p>(woman) I'm not sure. It's a little risk y. He might just say that we shouldn't have waited until the last minute.</p>
          <p>(man) Yeah, but, maybe if other students have the same problem you might be able to convince him.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, I mean, it's not our fault that the electricity went out. Hmmm..."</p>

        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>Briefly summarize the woman's problem then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p>

          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>For this task, the prompt asks you to briefly summarize the problem being discussed. In this item the problem is that the woman, because of a power failure, cannot use her computer to finish a term paper that is due tomorrow. The prompt then asks you to recommend one of the solutions and the reason for your solution. Taking time to summarize both solutions is not a requirement of the task and doing so may cause you to run out of time before stating your solution and the reason for your solution. You need to offer reasons and support for why you prefer one solution over the other. For example, if you prefer the first solution of writing the paper in the library, you could say that it would be quiet and easy to concentrate in the library. Another strategy is to provide reasons against the other solution. You could say you recommend going to the library because you know the professor will not give an extension and it would be a waste of time to ask him. If you choose to recommend the other solution, you would of course need to provide suitable reasons and support also.</p>

          <p>The speech in the response is clear and fluid, with few problems in pronunciation or intonation. The speaker's language use is also good and he demonstrates knowledge of a wide range of structures and vocabulary. The content is also organized well. He starts with a brief summary of the problem and includes a short summary of both solutions. He also chooses to include the drawback for the solution he doesn't choose (that the professor said he would not give extensions), which strengthens his argument. He includes good support for his solution, which is mainly an argument against the other solution: "She would be gambling thinking that the professor might agree to extend the period." He also uses appropriate transitional words and phrases, such as "in my opinion," which clearly show the progression of his ideas. He also provides a nice summary phrase at the end to conclude his response: "so it is better for her to go to the library." </p>

          <p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 62.</b></p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>The speaker's pronunciation of individual words is good. The pace of the response is fluid, also, though at times it seems rushed. A larger problem is his imprecise language use throughout; as a result, his ideas are unclear and confusing to the listener. In his summary of the problem, for example, he says "There is electricity . . . (unclear) and one of the student doesn't know how to do? The speaker does not adequately complete the task because he does not provide a clear solution. He does say that he thinks one of the options is a bad idea, which is not the same as stating a clear preference of solution and providing clear reasons. His language is also unclear when he says that the second option is a bad idea: "People shouldn't waste their time and work harder every day to avoid such problems like electricity." </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman's problem is that she has a history paper due tomorrow and her laptop's battery is running out but there's no electricity in her room to charge because of the storm. Accordingly, there are two solutions from the man: the first one is that she could go to a library in another city where she could get her lap top plugged in to continue her paper; second, she could ask her professor for an extension. Well, I guess the first solution is a better idea for some reasons. First of all, the library is not far away from the woman, and if she hurries, she could get the paper done and go home before the library close just in time. A library is a perfect place for study, and all she needs is to pack her computer and go driving, which surly beats staying home praying for the extension. Secondly, asking for an extension would be a bad idea. I think, after all there must be students going to the library or finding possible ways to get the paper done just on time, letting alone those who don't have electricity at home. So I think the woman should go to the library to finish her paper. (206 words)</p>
