          <p>The sea otter is a small mammal that lives in waters along the western coast of North America from California to Alaska. When some sea otter populations off the Alaskan coast started rapidly declining a few years ago, it caused much concern because sea otters play an important ecological role in the coastal ecosystem. Experts started investigating the cause of the decline and quickly realized that there were two possible explanations: environmental pollution or attacks by predators. Initially, the pollution hypothesis seemed the more likely of the two. The first reason why pollution seemed the more likely cause was that there were known sources of it along the Alaskan coast, such as oil rigs and other sources of industrial chemical pollution. Water samples from the area revealed increased levels of chemicals that could decrease the otters' resistance to life-threatening infections and thus could indirectly cause their deaths. Second, other sea mammals such as seals and sea lions along the Alaskan coast were also declining, indicating that whatever had endangered the otters was affecting other sea mammals as well. This fact again pointed to environmental pollution, since it usually affects the entire ecosystem rather than a single species. Only widely occurring predators, such as the orca (a large predatory whale), could have the same effect, but orcas prefer to hunt muchlarger prey, such as other whales. Third, scientists believed that the pollution hypothesis could also explain the uneven pattern of otter decline: at some Alaskan locations the otter populations declined greatly, while at others they remained stable. Some experts explained these observations by suggesting that ocean currents or other environmental factors may have created uneven concentrations of pollutants along the coast. </p>

          <p>Well, ongoing investigations have revealed that predation is the most likely cause of sea otter decline after all. Well, ongoing investigations have revealed that predation is the most likely cause of sea otter decline after all.</p>
          <p>First, the pollution theory is weakened by the fact that no one can really find any dead sea others washing off on Alaskan beaches. That's not what you would expect if infections caused by pollution started killing a lot of otters. On the other hand, the fact that it's so hard to find dead otters is consistent with the predator hypothesis. If an otter is killed by a predator, it's eaten immediately so it can't wash up on shore.</p>
          <p>Second, although orcas may prefer to hunt whales, whales have essentially disappeared from the area because of human hunters. That means that orcas have had to change their diet to survive and since only smaller sea mammals are now available, orcas have probably started hunting those. So it probably is the orcas that are causing the decline of all the smaller sea mammals mentioned in the passage - the seals, the sea lions and the sea otters.</p>
          <p>And third, the uneven pattern of otter decline is better explained by the orca predation theory than by the pollution theory. What happens to otters seems to depend on whether the location where they live is accessible to orcas or not. In those locations that orcas can access easily, the number of sea otters has declined greatly. However, because orcas are so large, they can't access shallow or rocky locations. And shallow and rocky locations are precisely the types of locations where sea otter populations have not declined.</p>

        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they respond to the specific points made reading passage. </p>

          <h5>Point Made in the Reading Passage</h5>
          <p>The passage argues that increased levels of potlution detected along the Alaskan coast could cause the deaths of sea otters by making them vulnerable to infections.</p>
          <p>The decline of other sea mammals (seals and sea lions) points to a systemic cause such as pollu- tion; the orca, a predator that could conceivably hunt several sea mammal species, is not the likely cause because it prefers larger prey such as whales.</p>
          <p>The decline of sea otter populations is greater in some locations than in others, which again seems consistent with the pollution theory since varying concentrations of pollutants could account for such an uneven pattern,</p>
          
          <h5>Contrasting Point from the Lecture</h5>
          <p>No dead sea otters have been found washed up on shore; this weakens the pollution theory but supports the predator theory, since the predators would eat the otters as they caught them, leaving no remains.</p>
          <p>Since the population of whales that orcas prefer to hunt has declined, orcas started hunting smaller prey, such as otters, as well as seals and sea lions.</p>
          <p>The uneven pattern of sea otter decline can be explained by the fact that some locations where sea otters live are accessible to orcas and some are not; the accessible areas experience decline, while the populations in the inaccessible areas remain steady. </p>

          <h5>Sample Response</h5>
          <p>The topic discussed here is the investigation of the causes of the disappearance of the sea otter, which is a small mammal that lives in waters along the western coast of North America from California to Alaska. The woman in the lecture argues that the cause of their disappearance is the presence of the predators, especially orcas, and not pollution as the reading says. </p>
          <p>Firstly, she argues that one of the proofs of their being attacked by the predators is the fact that no one can find any dead sea otters. If the cause was the pollution, many dead sea otters would be found along the shores. In addition, a predator will immediately eat its prey so this is why no dead sea otters were found. </p>
          <p>Secondly, the woman in the lecture argues there is another explanation than pollution why smaller sea mammals are all disappearing. She says that, since the whales tend to disappear because of the humans hunting them, the orcas had to adapt their food habits to the sea conditions and as a result they have started eating the smaller sea animals available among them sea otters being included. </p>
          <p>Thirdly, she argues that the orcas cannot access the shallow locations. This is why there are some areas where the sea otters are numerous. It's not because of uneven concentrations of pollutants.</p>
  
          <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
          <p>This response earns a score of 5. The response clearly conveys the three points from the lecture showing why predation by orcas is a better explanation than pollution for why no remains of the sea otters are found, for why a number of small animals including the sea otter started declining at the same time, and for why sea otter decline seems to have occurred to a lesser extent or not at all in some places, and to a greater extent in others. Grammatical errors are few and minor. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The lecturer and the reading passage suggest two competing theories, the predation theory vs. the pollution theory, to explain why the sea otter population is in rapid decline. The professor reasons that the absence of dead sea otters washed up the coast suggests that their decline is not caused by sea pollution but rather by sea predators who consume their bodies after Killing them. In contrast, the reading passage attributes the death of sea otters to pollution, citing evidence of increased sources of ocean contaminants which lead to greater vulnerability to infections. Furthermore, the lecturer argues that orcas are likely factors in the disappearance of sea otters, because the scarcity of whales, their usual prey, has left them with no other choice but to start hunting smaller mammals like the otters for food. The reading passage, on the other hand, Rules out this theory based on the orca's preying habit, and instead approves of the pollution theory as the only explanation for the decline op both large and small sea mammals across the entire ecosystem. Finally, according to the lecturer, the uneven pattern of sea otter decline corresponds to the distribution of the orcas. She argues that the pact that their population has declined most rapidly where orcas are most prevalent further validates the predation theory. However, the reading passage argues that changeable environmental factors, which lead to different concentrations of pollutants, better explains the varying pattern of sea otter decline.</p>
