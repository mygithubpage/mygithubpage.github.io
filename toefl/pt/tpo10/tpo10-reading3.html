Among the <span class="question2">key</span> factors behind this growth were increased agricultural <span class="highlight">productivity</span> and an <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span>.</p><p>Populations cannot grow unless the <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">economy</span> can produce enough <span class="highlight">additional</span> food to feed more people. During the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, farmers brought more land into <span class="highlight">cultivation</span> at the expense of forests and fens (<span class="highlight">low-lying</span> wetlands). Dutch land <span class="highlight">reclamation</span> in the Netherlands in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides the most <span class="highlight">spectacular</span> example of the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of farmland: the Dutch reclaimed more than 36.000 acres from 1590 to 1615 alone.</p><p>Much of the <span class="highlight">potential</span> for European <span class="highlight">economic</span><span class="highlight">development</span><span class="highlight">lay</span> in what at first <span class="highlight">glance</span> would <span class="highlight">seem</span> to have been only sleepy villages. Such villages, however, generally <span class="highlight">lay</span> in regions of <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">advanced</span> agricultural production, permitting not only the <span class="highlight">survival</span> of peasants but also the <span class="highlight">accumulation</span> of an agricultural <span class="highlight">surplus</span> for investment. They had <span class="highlight">access</span> to <span class="highlight">urban</span> merchants, markets, and <span class="highlight">trade</span> routes.</p><p>Increased agricultural production in turn facilitated <span class="highlight">rural</span><span class="highlight">industry</span>, an <span class="highlight">intrinsic</span> part of the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">industry</span>. Woolens and <span class="highlight">textile</span> manufacturers, in <span class="highlight">particular</span>, utilized <span class="highlight">rural</span> cottage (in-home) production, which took <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of cheap and <span class="highlight">plentiful</span><span class="highlight">rural</span> labor. In the German states, the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) further moved <span class="highlight">textile</span> production into the countryside. Members of poor peasant families spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant remuneration in an <span class="highlight">attempt</span> to <span class="highlight">supplement</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question6">meager</span></span> family income.</p><p>More extended trading networks also helped develop Europe's <span class="highlight">economy</span> in this period. <span class="question7">English and Dutch ships carrying <span class="highlight">rye</span> from the Baltic states reached Spain and Portugal.</span><span class="highlight">Population</span> growth generated an <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of small-scale manufacturing, particularly of handicrafts, textiles, and metal production in England, Flanders, parts of northern Italy, the southwestern German states, and parts of Spain. Only iron <span class="highlight">smelting</span> and <span class="highlight">mining</span> required marshaling a <span class="highlight">significant</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of capital (wealth invested to create more wealth).</p><p>The <span class="highlight">development</span> of banking and other <span class="highlight">financial</span> services contributed to the <span class="highlight">expansion</span> of <span class="highlight">trade</span>. By the middle of the sixteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, 
 financiers and traders commonly accepted bills of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> in place of gold or silver for other goods. Bills of <span class="highlight">exchange</span>, which had their origins in <span class="highlight">medieval</span> Italy, 
 were promissory notes (written promises to <span class="highlight">pay</span> a <span class="highlight">specified</span><span class="highlight">amount</span> of money by a certain <span class="highlight">date</span>) that could be sold to third parties. In this way, they provided <span class="highlight">credit</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>At mid-century, 
 an Antwerp financier only <span class="highlight">slightly</span> exaggerated when he claimed, "0ne can no more <span class="highlight">trade</span> without bills of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> than sail without water."  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Merchants no longer had to carry gold and 
 silver over long, dangerous journeys. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>An Amsterdam <span class="highlight">merchant</span> purchasing soap from a <span class="highlight">merchant</span> in Marseille could go to an exchanger and <span class="highlight">pay</span> the exchanger the <span class="highlight">equivalent</span><span class="highlight">sum</span> in guilders, 
 the Dutch <span class="highlight">currency</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>The exchanger would then send a <span class="highlight">bill</span> of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> to a <span class="highlight">colleague</span> in Marseille, authorizing the <span class="highlight">colleague</span> to <span class="highlight">pay</span> the Marseille <span class="highlight">merchant</span> in the <span class="highlight">merchant</span>'s own <span class="highlight">currency</span> 
 after the actual <span class="highlight">exchange</span> of goods had taken place.</p><p>Bills of <span class="highlight">exchange</span> contributed to the <span class="highlight">development</span> of banks, as exchangers began to provide loans. Not until the eighteenth <span class="highlight">century</span>, however, did such banks as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of England begin to provide capital for business investment. Their <span class="highlight">principal</span><span class="highlight">function</span> was to provide funds for the <span class="highlight">state</span>.</p><p>The rapid <span class="highlight">expansion</span> in international <span class="highlight">trade</span> also benefitted from an infusion of capital, stemming largely from gold and silver brought by Spanish vessels from the Americas. This capital financed the production of goods, <span class="highlight">storage</span>, <span class="highlight">trade</span>, and <span class="highlight">even</span><span class="highlight">credit</span><span class="highlight">across</span> Europe and <span class="highlight">overseas</span>. Moreover an increased <span class="highlight">credit</span><span class="highlight">supply</span> was generated by investments and loans by bankers and wealthy merchants to states and by joint-stock partnerships-<span class="question11">an English <span class="highlight">innovation</span></span> (the first <span class="highlight">major</span><span class="highlight">company</span> began in 1600). Unlike short-term <span class="highlight">financial</span><span class="highlight">cooperation</span> between investors for a single <span class="highlight">commercial</span><span class="highlight">undertaking</span>, joint-stock companies provided <span class="highlight">permanent</span><span class="highlight">funding</span> of capital by drawing on the investments of merchants and other investors who purchased shares in the <span class="highlight">company</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, what was true of Europe during the medieval period?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Agricultural productivity declined.</p><p>B. There was relatively little economic growth.</p><p>C. The general level of prosperity declined.</p><p>D. Foreign trade began to play an important role in the economy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Positioning to the first sentence with the <span class="question2">key</span>word period, saying that the period is less prosperous, but if you look at this sentence it is easy to mis-choose the answer C. The decay of C is called decrease, that is to say, the prosperity of Medisval declines in C. , but the original text is not prosperous, it is a low state, not a downward trend, so C is wrong; and B's economy has almost no growth is a synonymous replacement of less prosperous, correct; A and C are similar to the reasons for the wrong; D Did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">key</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. historical</p><p>B. many</p><p>C. important</p><p>D. hidden</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Key: Critical, important. A is history; B is many; C is important; D is hidden. The <span class="question2">key</span> is commonly known as the <span class="question2">key</span>, and of course, the <span class="question2">key</span> meaning, so C's important is correct. The previous article said that the European economy has started to grow, and then what factors of development are blabla, and the reason behind this is definitely relatively important, so Important correct. The sentence only gives two reasons, many are wrong; historical historical and hidden are completely unreliable.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, one effect of the desire to increase food production was that</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. land was cultivated in a different way</p><p>B. more farmers were needed</p><p>C. the rural economy was weakened</p><p>D. forests and wetlands were used for farming</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D. Use the <span class="question2">key</span>word <span class="question2">key</span>word to locate the first sentence with increment food production, but the question is the influence, so the answer should be the next sentence. It is said that people open more land, at the expense of forests and wetlands, so the answer is D. The original A did not say that it was a different way of reclamation and error; B's farmers had no relevant information; C's rural economy had no information.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what was one reason villages had such great economic potential?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Villages were located in regions where agricultural production was relatively advanced.</p><p>B. Villages were relatively small in population and size compared with urban areas.</p><p>C. Some village inhabitants made investments in industrial development.</p><p>D. Village inhabitants established markets within their villages.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses economic potential as the <span class="question2">key</span> word to locate the first sentence, but the first sentence of at first glance and the second sentence of who always indicate useful information in the second sentence, saying that the village's agriculture is advanced, so the answer is A. Did not say B/C/D.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 4 supports the idea that increased agricultural production was important for the expansion of industry primarily because it</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. increased the number of available workers in rural areas</p><p>B. provided new types of raw materials for use by industry</p><p>C. resulted in an improvement in the health of the rural cottage workers used by manufacturers</p><p>D. helped repair some of the ravages of the Thirty Years' War</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uses the expansion of industry as the <span class="question2">key</span> word to locate the first sentence, but the first sentence merely states a fact. The useful information is in the second sentence, saying that those manufacturers use a lot of cheap rural labor, so the answer is A, B/ C/D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question6">meager</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. very necessary</p><p>B. very low</p><p>C. traditional</p><p>D. primary</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Meager: Poor, inadequate, and thin. A is necessary; B is very small, poor; C is traditional; D is the main. So B's very low is the correct answer. Corresponding to the original: Members of poor peasant families spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant remuneration in an attempt to supplement <span class="question6">meager</span> family income. The original sentence says that many poor people's textile lines or weaving fabrics earn subsidies to supplement what kind of family income, certainly It is necessary for supplementation to be low, so it is very low, A and D are basically not able to use the textile line to subsidize; the original has no concept of time, so the traditional B is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention that "<span class="highlight">English and Dutch ships carrying rye from the Baltic states reached Spain and Portugal</span>"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.
