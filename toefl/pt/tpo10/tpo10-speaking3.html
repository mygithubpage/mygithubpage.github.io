I think the lobby at the entrance to the student center would be a great location. Since many students pass through the student center every day, artwork displayed in the lobby would be viewed by hundreds of people. Also, because the whole front of the building is made of glass windows, the lobby is filled with natural light. This makes it perfect for displaying artwork, which should have plenty of light to be seen and appreciated.
Sincerely,
Paul Sands</p></article><div><audio src="tpo10-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to two students discussing the letter.</p><p>(man) Mary, you're an art student. What do you think of this letter?</p><p>(woman) I don't like the idea.</p><p>(man) Why not?</p><p>(woman) Well, first of all, his first point about a lot of people passing through the student center, that's true, but..</p><p>(man) But?</p><p>(woman) But it's always crowded with people coming and going. It's not good for showing artwork. Imagine you're standing there, trying to look at the painting, it's gonna be like a million people walking through. People walking in front of you, blocking your view, distracting you.</p><p>(man) Hmmm. Yeah, I haven't thought of it.</p><p>(woman) You won't be able to appreciate the artwork or get a good look at anything with so much going on, with so many people moving around.</p><p>(man) Yeah, I see what you mean.</p><p>(woman) Plus, he's wrong about the windows.</p><p>(man) But isn't it true that it's good for art to have lots of light?</p><p>(woman) In a sense, yeah, but that kind of light, all that natural light from windows, that's actually not good, because if it's really sunny out it will be way too bright, if it's cloudy, it will be way too dark.</p><p>(man) Oh!</p><p>(woman) What you want is controlled light, consistent light, the kind you get from electrical light bulb. Think about in an art museum. In an art museum, you've got electric lighting and the light is always carefully controlled, always at the same level.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the proposal in the student's letter. Then state the woman's opinion about the proposal and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>When answering this question, it is important to include information from both the reading passage and the conversation between students. Begin by summarizing the student's proposal, which is that the lobby of the student center should be selected as the location for a student art display. Then indicate the woman's opinion of the proposal and why she feels that way. In this item, you would say that the woman disagrees that the lobby is a good place for the art displays. She says that because there are so many people passing through the lobby, it will make it difficult to view the artwork. Also, the natural light in the lobby is sometimes too bright or too dark for viewing artwork (and it is better to have controlled electric light). </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well according to the proposal, the student's suggesting that the university should display the students' paintings and other artworks at the entrance to the students' center. However the woman disagrees with that proposal for two main reasons. First of all, she thinks the entrance of the students' center is crowded with people coming and going, which will block the views of the displays and is very distracting. Secondly, she believes that the displays need controlled lights like art museum to keep the light always at the same level instead of the natural light from windows which is changing all the time, either too bright or too dark. So based on the reasons given above the woman disagrees with the proposal.

She explains the proposal clearly and efficiently, and covers the woman's opinion about the natural light with great detail. She does a particularly good job of organizing her response. For example, after she summarizes the letter-writer's proposal, she says "these last two points are actually exactly the points the woman is criticizing . . before continuing on to the woman's opinion, and this transition makes her ideas easy to follow. She does not talk as much about how crowding in the lobby makes the artwork difficult to view, but she does mention it in sufficient detail. She has a wide vocabulary range, and is able to summarize ideas in her own words, such as saying "the light is dependent on the weather" to summarize the woman's point about natural light. Her pronunciation, pacing, and intonation are also clear and effective, so it is not difficult for listeners to understand her. </p><p><b>Low-level Response: Listen to Track 58.</b></p><p><audio src="track_58.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker's response contains relevant points, such as using a lobby to display art work, the fact that the woman doesn't agree, and an explanation for why she doesn't agree. He makes some factual errors, however, such as claiming the newspaper itself is recommending the new location for the artwork. Most importantly, the response contains some major grammar problems that make it difficult to understand. For example, the speaker says "the one who is going to just appreciate art work will be know it," which does not make much sense. Sometimes the speaker's pronunciation of individual words is difficult to understand as well, such as the word "proposal!' </p></div></main></body></html>
