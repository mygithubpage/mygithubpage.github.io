Entertainment merchandising is a form of marketing in which the brand or image from one product is also used to sell another. The practice of entertainment merchandising often occurs in connection with movies and television shows, especially those associated with children. For example, the success of a popular children's television show may result in the marketing of toys that are designed to look like characters in the show. Or the satiation may be reversed when a children's television show is written to include characters that are based on already-popular toys.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo10-speaking4.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to a lecture from a marketing class.</p><p>(male professor): Ok, so I've actually got a few different examples of this. You know, uh, when I was a kid, a character named Action Hero was really popular with my friends and me. We would always watch the Action Hero program on television every week and played games pretending we were strong and powerful as he was. Then pretty soon we began seeing these small Action Hero figures in all the stores. And, well, we all just had to have them. I mean, we've been watching the television show for so long that it seemed only natural to want to own toys, too.Well, I finally grew up and left Action Hero television program and toys behind. But, now, I have a 7-year-old daughter who watches television a lot and also like to play with her toys. And lately her favorite toy is a cute little baby doll with a big round face and lots of curly hair named Rosa. All my daughter's friends have Rosa dolls, too. And they enjoy going to each other's houses to play with them. Then a few weeks ago, my daughter came running up to me all excited because she just heard that there is going to be a new television program on every week with the doll, Rosa, as the main character. So naturally she and all her friends have begun watching the show. And it's already very popular, as popular as the toy doll.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the examples from the lecture, explain the concept of Entertainment Merchandising. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>For this task, the prompt asks you to use the examples from the lecture to explain the concept described in the reading. You should begin your response by briefly explaining entertainment merchandising (a type of marketing where a popular brand or image of one product is used to sell another product). For the first example from the lecture, you could begin by mentioning that entertainment merchandising often occurs when children's toys are created based on popular characters in a television program or movie. For example, the professor and his friends bought Actionhero toys because they liked the Action-hero TV show. For the second example from the lecture, you could explain that entertainment merchandising can also work in a reverse way from the first example—sometimes TV shows or movies become popular because they are based on well-known children's toys. For instance, the professor's daughter enjoys playing with a doll named Rosa. So, when a TV show about Rosa is created, she and her friends begin watching it..</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Entertainment merchandising is an effective way of marketing in which a brand or an image from one product is used to sell another. And this is usually used in shows and movies connected with children. For example, when the professor was a kid, he and his friends really enjoyed a TV character called action hero. And they usually played together, pretending to be action heros . So when the toy that featured action heros came out, they all wanted it, and it was already popular from the onset. This is how entertainment merchandising markets a new toy with a popular TV show. In another example, however, the situation is reversed. The professor's daughter loves to play a cute little baby doll called Rosa, since it's very popular among little girls. When the TV show features Rosa as its main character, it becomes immediately successful, just like the action hero toy.

However, her summary of the examples shows that she fully understood how the lecture relates to the reading. She does not confuse any details, remembering that Action-hero was first a television show and then a toy but that the Rosa doll was first a toy and then a television show. Her pronunciation is easy to understand, and she speaks without pausing or hesitating. She uses complex sentences ("And then, they create a television show which has the doll Rosa as the main character") and shows a good range of vocabulary. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 60.</b></p><p><audio src="track_60.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker mostly does a good job of explaining all the main points of the reading and the lecture. Her first sentence, explaining the concept of entertainment merchandising, is very clear. Her explanation of the Action-hero example is also good, but she has significant difficulty explaining the example of the Rosa doll. For example, she says, "after she was bought from all the kids' society," which is unclear. It can be inferred from the rest of the response that she understands the basic ideas in the lecture, but parts of her response are a little confusing. Overall, her pronunciation is clear and she speaks fluently. She has some minor grammatical errors, but she is still easy to understand. </p></div></main></body></html>
