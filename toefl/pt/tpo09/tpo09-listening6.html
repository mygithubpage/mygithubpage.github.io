No. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.47" data-time="275.04">[04:35.04]</span>But the <span class="highlight">discrete</span> units that make up language can be put together in different ways. <span class="time" data-times="9.9" data-time="282.51">[04:42.51]</span>Those smaller parts can be used to form an infinite number of messages, including messages that are completely <span class="highlight">novel</span>, that have never been expressed before. <span class="time" data-times="19" data-time="292.41">[04:52.41]</span>For example, we can <span class="highlight">differentiate</span> between: "A large <span class="highlight">coyote</span> moves fast." and say "Move the large <span class="highlight">coyote</span> fast."or "Move fast, large <span class="highlight">coyote</span>.", and I truly <span class="highlight">doubt</span> whether anyone has ever uttered either of these sentences before. <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="311.41">[05:11.41]</span>Human language is <span class="highlight">productive</span>, an open-ended communication system, whereas no other communication system has this <span class="highlight">property</span>. </p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.56" data-time="321.18">[05:21.18]</span>And another feature of language that's not displayed by any form of animal communication is what we call "displacement". <span class="time" data-times="7.06" data-time="329.74">[05:29.74]</span>That is, language is <span class="highlight">abstract</span> enough that we can talk about things that aren't present here and now. <span class="time" data-times="6.89" data-time="336.8">[05:36.80]</span>Things like "My friend Joe is not in the room." or "It will probably rain next Thursday." <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="343.69">[05:43.69]</span><span class="highlight">Prairie</span> dogs may be able to tell you about a <span class="highlight">hawk</span> that's circling overhead right now, but they never show any <span class="highlight">inclination</span> to <span class="highlight">describe</span> the one they saw last week.  </p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mainly discuss?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

But the evidence for this choice is not enough, listen to the contents below. The following professor discusses several features, human uniqueness. So you can choose C. The other options are too one-sided, and the answer to the subject matter will not be the details.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the student mention a research project she studied in a biology class?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out similarities in the behavior of rodents and monkeys.</p><p>B. To explain how she first became interested in animal communication.</p><p>C.

She sees the study as proof that mammals other than humans possess a form of language.</p><p>D. She thinks the researchers misinterpreted the high-pitched barks as warming signals.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The professor denied the searchers' choice.
