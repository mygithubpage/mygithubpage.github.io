Which do you agree with? Explain why.</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>In this question, you need to say whether you think family members or friends are the most important influence on young adults. Then you must explain why this is your preference. You should try to explain it fully; you should not just give a list of reasons. Instead, you should try to pick one or two reasons and explain your opinion in more detail. Add examples when appropriate. If you think family members are the most important influence, for example, you could explain by discussing reasons such as the amount of time young adults spend with family versus friends, which gives family members more opportunities to influence them.</p><P>Sometimes test-takers would like to choose both options, saying, for example, that one might be more true in some circumstances and the other true in different circumstances. This approach is acceptable; however, it is difficult to then fully explain your opinion if you choose both options, and it might lower your score if you don't finish or don't sufficiently support both choices during your response time. Only very fluent speakers should use the approach of choosing both options.</P></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I believe friends are the most important influence. We all know that one takes the behavior of one's company. Friends are always our companies. We play games together, keep secrets and talk anything we like. We share interests and hobbies. For example, many of my friends like playing basketball because I like playing basketball very much. I learned a lot from my friends, their way of talking and their behaviors. However, I rarely spent time with my cousins or with my parents. They might have some influence on me, but they are definitely not the most important influence. In a word, because we are closest to our friends, friends have the most important influence on us.</p></article></div><div><p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 23.</b></p><p><audio src="track_23.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker states her view that both family members and friends influence young adults depending on the stage of life they're in, and then supports this view fully by describing the stages of life when family and when friends have an influence. She provides examples of when family members are more influential and when friends are, and discusses the importance of friends when you're separated from your family, such as when you're away at college. Her pronunciation is clear and she does not need to pause to think of how to say her ideas in English. Sometimes her vocabulary choices are not perfect—for example, she says "how you wear" instead of "how you dress," but these errors are minor and the listener can still easily understand her ideas.</p><p><b>Low-level Response: Listen to Track 24.</b></p><p><audio src="track_24.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker's pronunciation of individual words is fairly clear, but he pauses and hesitates often to think of the next word to say. His hesitations cause him to run out of time before he can finish what he would like to say. This shows that he still needs to improve his fluency in English. Also, while he states which view he agrees with—that friends are the most important influence—he does not develop this idea with much detail. He says "they spend much of their time with their friends," but he doesn't explain why this causes friends to have more influence, possibly because he lacks the vocabulary to talk more about it. Instead, he simply repeats that friends are the most important influence.</p></div></main></body></html>
