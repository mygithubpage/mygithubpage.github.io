What's wrong?</p><p>(woman) I just found out I have to move out of my apartment, like, right away.</p><p>(man) You're kidding! Why?</p><p>(woman) Well, my apartment, it's in a house, a kind of old house. And now something's wrong with the water pipes. I think some of the pipes burst or wore out or something. Anyway, we don't have any water in the house, and apparently it's gonna take two weeks to fix the problem.</p><p>(man) So you need to find a place to live for what? two weeks or so?</p><p>(woman) Yeah, bad timing, huh? With mid-term exams coming up and everything!</p><p>(man) So you've figured out what you're going to do?</p><p>(woman) Well, some friends said I could stay at their place. They don't have an extra bedroom but they said it'd be OK for me to sleep on their living room couch.</p><p>(man) You could probably handle that for a couple of weeks, right?</p><p>(woman) I guess so. I mean it's really nice of them to offer. And it's free! The only problem is they alread y have four people living there so it could be a little crowded.</p><p>(man) And not ideal for studying for mid-terms.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, too many distractions.</p><p>(man) Hmmm, any other options?</p><p>(woman) Well, I did find this place. It's a small hotel over on 3 street right near campus.</p><p>(man) Oh, right! A lot of kid's parents stay there when they come for a visit.</p><p>(woman) Right. So I could get a room there. They have a weekly rate and it's pretty reasonable. But, I don't know.</p><p>(man) At least at the hotel you'd have a space of your own, you know, so you could get more done.</p><p>(woman) That's definitely a plus. But I have to think about it. Even though it's pretty cheap, it'll still end up costing me some money. And my budget is pretty tight right now."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>For this task, the prompt asks you to briefly summarize the problem being discussed (the woman has a problem in her house with the water—the pipes broke—and she needs a place to stay temporarily) and recommend one of the solutions. It is important to note that taking time to summarize both solutions is not a requirement of the task. Summarizing the problem, however, is required. You should also offer reasons and support for why you prefer one solution over the other. If you prefer the second solution, for example, you may say that it is worth spending the extra money on a hotel since getting good grades on her exams should be her priority as a student.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the woman's problem is that there's something wrong with the water pipes in her house and it takes two weeks to fix the pipes so she has to move out to find some place for her mid-term preparation. Accordingly, there are two options for her to solve the problem: first, she could move to her friends' place; and second, she could find a small hotel near her campus. I think, the second solution is a better idea. Firstly, going to a hotel means personal space and quiet study atmosphere so she will surely prepare herself well for her mid-term. Secondly, the hotel can cost on a weekly rate which is quite reasonable for the woman, so I think she can afford it for the sake of better concentration on study after class. After all the main duty of the students is to study. So based on the reasons stated above I agree and recommend the second solution.

The speaker explains the woman's problem quickly and clearly. Even though it is not required of the task, she briefly mentions what the two solutions from the conversation are before choosing the second solution (staying in a hotel) and defending her choice with reasons. The response is not perfect—the speaker says the woman should "rent a small hotel" instead of a hotel room, and she pauses at times and repeats some phrases. However, her pronunciation is easy to follow and she uses advanced grammatical structures to express her opinion, like when she says that the woman "wouldn't have to worry about noise and inconveniencing other people" if she stayed in a hotel. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 30.</b></p><p><audio src="track_30.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker makes a clear choice of solution and gives some reasons for that choice. It's clear from her response that she understands what the woman's problem is; however, to improve on this response she could have begun by summarizing the problem explicitly before recommending a solution. The speaker is not able to convey the reasons for her recommendation very clearly or with precise language. For example, when trying to explain that the woman needs to stay in a hotel so that she can focus on studying for exams, she says, "and . . . two weeks is an amount of time, and by the time she's going to have her midterm exams, which is very important to get. . ." The listener has to make an effort here to understand what the speaker is trying to say. Her frequent pauses and some repetitions of certain words and phrases also require enough listener effort to place this response in the mid-level. </p></div></main></body></html>
