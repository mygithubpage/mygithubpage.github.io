Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. </p></section><section><h4>Topic Notes</h4><p>If you <b>agree</b> with the statement and believe that technology stifles children's creativity;<b>1.</b> you might support that by explaining how the computer keeps kids in the home and away from other kids; the ability to deploy communication skills in face-to-face situations, suffers as a consequence, and this in turn hinders the development of creativity. <b>2.</b> You might argue that children who experience the world by being out in it rather than being online all the time can use their imagination to create their own games or put on performances; however, this has become very rare these days because with the advancement of technology, most forms of entertainment that kids are interested in are ready-made. <b>3.</b> You could even extend the argument to say that this is becoming a problem with modern life in general: most problems have been solved, so no special thinking or creativity by anyone—whether it be adults or kids—is needed these days to deal with new situations or problems.</p><p>If you <b>disagree</b> with the statement, you might point out and develop the ways in which technology stimulates the imagination. <b>1.</b> Rather than stifling creativity, technology allows kids to engage in such creative endeavors as producing their own blogs and websites, or designing clever and interesting new games and apps for computers or phones. <b>2.</b> More resources and viewpoints than ever before are now within reach of most people, including children, because technology has provided us with new ways to access such a wealth of information; this exposure can lead to enhanced creativity. In a response that explores reasons for disagreeing with the statement, you might come to the conclusion that the meaning of creativity itself has shifted over time. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><article><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Are our kids becoming lazier and less creative, less imaginable than before as a consequence of highly advanced technology? My answer is no, and just the opposite, technology has apparently assisted our kids to become more creative.</p><p>First and foremost, technology has provided children with easy access to scientific and liberal art resources which is their best source of inspiration. For example, children could now easily gain access to academic databases through iPad screen, read classical works on Kindle, or watch historic documents on Internet. These great works are essentially helpful to arousing their curiosity and prepares them with key knowledge   necessary for any creation. However, these wonderful equipments and facilities are never as handy in the past, when kids could only reach limited resources in public libraries or schools. In this sense, technology has provided the possibility for children to be more creative.</p><p>Second, technology has equipped children with professional apparatus which could finally realize their imagination. This takes form particularly as computer softwares and applications, such as Photoshop for creative graphic design, Overture for easily composing a piece of music, 3DMax for building up a virtual world, etc. All the softwares were never as handy as they are at present, and this would absolutely provide our children an effective tool for realizing their creativity.</p><p>Third, technology itself is a market place where creative ideas are economically encouraged. Steve Jobs earned millions of dollars a year for his unparalleled creation, and Mark Zuckberg gained his reputation for the genius social network. Therefore, technology has provided children the internal motive to develop their creativity.</p><p>However, it is undeniable that technology might make children become lazier and be comfortable with what is already available because everything are so convenient nowadays and there seems to be no way to improve them. Children lost in pc games or blindly pursuing every single piece of tech apparatus is a relevant example. Thus, it is always necessary to keep children's mind active in the marvelous world of technology.</p><p>In a nutshell, I still regard children as becoming increasingly creative in technology development, although it might bring minor side effect. As long as we keep a balanced mood on children enjoying the fruit of technology, they are sure to contribute more to innovation than in the past.</p></article><h4>Note</h4></article></div><article><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Technology is today part of the everyday life; we are surrounded it by it and can't live without it. But despite all the good things that derive from technology, I strongly agree that there are some ways that technology causes children to think less.</p><p>For one thing, there is almost no information that cannot be found on the internet. When it comes to reading, many high school students agree to refer to "notes" sites instead of reading a complete book assigned by their teachers. These sites usually map out the important stories, passages, and characters for the student. This destroys creativity by not allowing the student to understand the story on his or her own and discover the true personal meanings of the assignment. An activity such as reading is suppose to question one's intellect and challenge one's thinking but with these sites available, kids now rely on the information given and fail to appreciate and grow that is the purpose of reading many books.</p><p>During other activities encountered in school, such as projects, children now tend to rely on the internet to come up with ideas. I have observed this many times. When a creative assignment is given by the teacher, instead of brainstorming ideas together, children just hop on a computer and search for ideas on the internet. It's one thing to use the internet as a tool as oppose to using it incessantly and not letting your imagination and creativity take charge.</p><p>Other forms of technology such as video games and TV has a great impact on using up time that used to be devoted to imagination and creative activities. Before TV and computer, children invented their world just on their own using their fantasy when building things with blocks or being outdoors in the nature. They used simple things for constructing adventures and had great ideas for new games together or alone. This means they learn to be creative and also self-determined and self-conscious. Nowaday, how can they learn these skills when passively watching TV or doing what the computer says? </p><p>In summary, there is a lot about technology that takes away from chances for children to be creative and develop creative skills. </p><h5>Rater Comments</h5><p>This 5-level response mainly presents examples of how technology has reduced opportunities to be creative and develop creative skills. <b>1.</b> The writer first discusses the existence of book summaries and interpretive notes on Web sites, and explains how students use this information instead of actually reading books assigned at school; this results in students not being able to read well or form their own creative interpretations of what they are reading. <b>2.</b> In the third paragraph the writer talks about students getting ideas for projects from Web sites instead of interacting with other students to creatively brainstorm ideas together. <b>3.</b> And in the fourth paragraph the writer explains that what used to be time for creative fantasizing or inventing playtime activities has now been replaced by time watching TV or following instructions on the computer. This response is well-organized and unified, and gives ample support for the writer's point of view. Grammatical errors are very minor and a variety of complex structures are used.</p></article></main></body></html>
