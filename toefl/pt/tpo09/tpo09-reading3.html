A few of these spores found a toehold on the dark, forbidding rocks and grew and began to work their <span class="highlight">transformation</span> upon the land. Lichens were probably the first successful <span class="highlight">flora</span>. These are not single <span class="highlight">individual</span> plants; each one is a symbiotic <span class="highlight">combination</span> of an <span class="highlight">alga</span> and a <span class="highlight">fungus</span>. The <span class="highlight">algae</span><span class="highlight">capture</span> the sun's energy by <span class="highlight">photosynthesis</span> and store it in <span class="highlight">organic</span> molecules. The <span class="highlight">fungi</span><span class="highlight">absorb</span><span class="highlight">moisture</span> and <span class="highlight">mineral</span> salts from the rocks, passing these on in <span class="highlight">waste</span> products that <span class="highlight">nourish</span><span class="highlight">algae</span>. <span class="question3">It is <span class="highlight">significant</span> that the earliest living thing that built communities on these islands are examples of symbiosis, a <span class="highlight">phenomenon</span> that depends upon the close <span class="highlight">cooperation</span> of two or more forms of life and a <span class="highlight">principle</span> that is very important in island communities.</span></p><p>Lichens helped to speed the <span class="highlight">decomposition</span> of the hard rock surfaces, preparing a <span class="highlight">soft</span> bed of soil that was <span class="question4">abundantly</span> supplied with minerals that had been carried in the <span class="highlight">molten</span> rock from the bowels of Earth. Now, other forms of life could take hold: ferns and mosses (two of the most <span class="highlight">ancient</span> types of land plants) that <span class="highlight">flourish</span><span class="highlight">even</span> in rock crevices. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>These plants <span class="highlight"><span class="question5">propagate</span></span> by producing sporesï¿½tiny <span class="highlight">fertilized</span> cells that <span class="highlight">contain</span> all the instructions for making a new plantï¿½but the <span class="highlight">spore</span> are unprotected by any outer <span class="highlight">coating</span> and carry no <span class="highlight">supply</span> of <span class="highlight">nutrient</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span><span class="highlight">Vast</span> numbers of them fall on the ground <span class="highlight">beneath</span> the mother plants. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Sometimes they are carried farther <span class="highlight">afield</span> by water or by wind. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>But only those few spores that <span class="highlight">settle</span> down in very <span class="highlight">favorable</span> locations can start new life; the <span class="highlight">vast</span><span class="highlight">majority</span> fall on <span class="highlight">barren</span> ground. By force of <span class="highlight">sheer</span> numbers, however, the mosses and ferns reached Hawaii, survived, and multiplied. Some <span class="highlight">species</span> developed great size, becoming tree ferns that <span class="highlight">even</span> now grow in the Hawaiian forests.</p><p>Many millions of years after ferns evolved (but long before the Hawaiian Islands were born from the sea), another kind of <span class="highlight">flora</span> evolved on Earth: the seed-bearing plants. <span class="question7">This</span> was a wonderful biological invention. The seed has an outer <span class="highlight">coating</span> that surrounds the <span class="highlight">genetic</span><span class="highlight">material</span> of the new plant, and inside this covering is a concentrated <span class="highlight">supply</span> of nutrients. Thus the seed's chances of <span class="highlight">survival</span> are greatly enhanced over those of the <span class="highlight">naked</span><span class="highlight">spore</span>. One type of seed-bearing plant, the <span class="highlight">angiosperm</span>, includes all forms of blooming <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>. In the <span class="highlight">angiosperm</span> the seeds are wrapped in an <span class="highlight">additional</span><span class="highlight">layer</span> of covering. Some of these coats are hardï¿½like the <span class="highlight">shell</span> of a nutï¿½for <span class="highlight">extra</span> protection. Some are <span class="highlight">soft</span> and tempting, like a peach or a cherry. In some angiosperms the seeds are equipped with gossamer wings, like the <span class="highlight">dandelion</span> and milkweed seeds. These new characteristics offered better ways for the seed to move to new habitats. They could travel <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">air</span>, <span class="highlight">float</span> in water, and lie <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">dormant</span></span> for many months.</p><p>Plants with large, <span class="highlight">buoyant</span> seeds-like coconuts-<span class="highlight">drift</span> on ocean currents and are washed up on the shores. Remarkably <span class="highlight">resistant</span> to the vicissitudes of ocean travel, they can <span class="highlight">survive</span><span class="highlight">prolonged</span> immersion in saltwater when they come to rest on warm beaches and the conditions are <span class="highlight">favorable</span>, the seed coats soften. Nourished by their imported <span class="highlight">supply</span> of nutrients, the young plants push out their roots and <span class="highlight">establish</span> their place in the sun.</p><p>By means of these seeds, plants <span class="highlight">spread</span> more widely to new locations, <span class="highlight">even</span> to <span class="highlight">isolated</span> islands like the Hawaiian <span class="highlight">archipelago</span>, which lies more than 2,000 miles west of California and 3,500 miles east of Japan. The seeds of grasses, flowers, and blooming trees made the long trips to these islands. (Grasses are simple forms of angiosperms that <span class="highlight">bear</span> their encapsulated seeds on long stalks.) In a surprisingly short time, angiosperms filled many of the land areas on Hawaii that had been <span class="highlight">bare</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight">at random</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. finally</p><p>B. over a long period of time</p><p>C. successfully</p><p>D. without a definite pattern</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="at random D"><p>BDE</p><p>The structure of this paper is rather special in TOEFL reading. It is a review of the study and mainly introduces two people's research on the practice of education reflection.</p><p>The first paragraph said the importance of educational reflection.</p><p>The second paragraph says that W and N have studied the conditions for implementing reflective education.</p><p>The third paragraph is still a study of the conditions for implementing reflective education, emphasizing sound ability to understand classroom events in an objective manner.</p><p>The fourth paragraph continues with three paragraphs, emphasizing that training can be achieved through education.</p><p>The five paragraphs introduce the three principles that W and N found to implement education reflection: leadership support, time and space, and team atmosphere.</p><p>The last paragraph said that W and N emphasize difficulties, and others' research emphasizes the importance of motivation.</p><p>The guide sentence is a summary of the article.</p><p>The A(through) option is wrong. The original is just that the reflection is good for the teacher. It has nothing to do with the student.</p><p>The B (Wildman and Niles found) option corresponds to the fourth paragraph of the original text, correct.</p><p>The C (Wildman and Niles identify) option seems to correspond to five paragraphs. It is somewhat confusing. The original text emphasizes the team and emphasizes leadership support. It does not say that individuals can handle it. Therefore, this option is wrong and should not be selected.</p><p>The D (Wildman and Niles conclude) option corresponds to the three principals in the fifth paragraph of the original text, correct.</p><p>The E (There are) option corresponds to the two parts of the sixth paragraph of the original text and is correct.</p><p>The F(Whether) option seems to correspond to the second half of the original paragraph, but the original only speaks of motivation, and does not speak of nature and intensity.......</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that the fungi in lichens benefit from their symbiotic relationship with algae in what way?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The algae help the fungi meet some of their energy needs.</p><p>B. The algae protect the fungi from the Sun's radiation.</p><p>C. The algae provide the fungi with greater space for absorbing water.</p><p>D. The fungi produce less waste in the presence of algae.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A After lichen, fungus, and algae were targeted to the third sentence, algae captured solar energy and stored it, while fungi absorbed minerals from the soil and nourished algae. The question is how fungi can benefit, so the first half of the sentence is the answer and A is correct. Although B mentioned sun, but it was not protected. Be careful not to make mistakes. C and D did not say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Some of the earliest important examples of symbiosis-the close cooperation of two or more living things-occur in island communities.</p><p>B. Symbiosis-the close cooperation of pairs or small groups of living organisms-is especially important in these island environments.</p><p>C. The first organisms on these islands worked together closely in a relationship known as symbiosis, which is particularly important on islands.</p><p>D. It is significant to note that organisms in the beginning stages of the development of island life cannot survive without close cooperation.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. The original language says that the earliest living creatures on the island were symbiosis and then explained symbiosis. A's "occur on island community" concept is stolen, the original text is used to modify the living thing, there is no major meaning of this layer, wrong; the original said biological energy symbiosis, and then said symbiosis is very important, B missing information, did not mention To the earliest creature, wrong; C correct; D completely changed the structure of the original text, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">abundantly</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. occasionally</p><p>B. plentifully</p><p>C. usefully</p><p>D. fortunately</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Abundantly: <span class="question4">abundantly</span>, in large quantities. A is occasional; B is <span class="question4">abundantly</span>, <span class="question4">abundantly</span>; C is usefully; D is fortunate. So B's plentifully correct. Corresponding to the original: Lichens helped to speed the decomposition of the hard rock surfaces, preparing a soft bed of soil that was <span class="question4">abundantly</span> supplied with minerals that had been carried in the molten rock from the bowels of Earth. The original sentence lichens accelerated the decomposition of the rock How do you provide the minerals in the rocks? The rocks are broken down, and the minerals in the rocks are dispersed into the soil. There is certainly more. A's occasionally said anti-; C and D completely do not fly.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">propagate</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. multiply</p><p>B. emerge</p><p>C. live</p><p>D. evolve</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>Propagate: Reproduction, spread. A is breeding, increasing; B is emerging; C is survival; D is evolution. So A's multiply is correct. Corresponding to the original: These plants <span class="question5">propagate</span> by producing sporesï¿½tiny fertilized cells that contain all the instructions for making a new plantï¿½but the spore are unprotected by any outer coating and carry no supply of nutrient. The original sentence says that these plants produce small spores by Why do you explain the spore is a small cell, contains all the necessary information to make a new plant, from the making a new plant to see the meaning of reproduction, so the correct answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what was the relationship between lichens and ferns in the development of plant life on Hawaii?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Ferns were able to grow because lichens created suitable soil.</p><p>B. The decomposition of ferns produced minerals that were used by lichens.</p><p>C. Lichens and ferns competed to grow in the same rocky environments.</p><p>D. Lichens and ferns were typically found together in volcanic areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Lichen and fern do the keyword positioning to the first two sentences, saying that lichen broke down the rock, prepared mineral-rich soil, then other plants came, and then there was fern, so lichen's effect on fern is Provide suitable soil for growth, A correct. B wrong, the original saying that the decomposition is not fern, is the rock; C and D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">This</span></span>" in the passage refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the spread of ferns and mosses in Hawaii</p><p>B. the creation of the Hawaiian Islands</p><p>C. the evolution of ferns</p><p>D. the development of plants that produce seeds</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D this refers to the entire sentence before, see the latter part of the principle of the nearest, said another flora evolved on the earth, after the colon is the flora, namely: seed-bearing flower, so the latter that this should refer to this flora The evolution of this sentence from the sentence in which this is located knows that this is a biological invention and it is more certain that the answer is D.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, why do seeds have a greater chance of survival than spores do? To receive credit, you must select TWO answer choices.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Seeds need less water to grow into a mature plant than spores do.</p><p>B. Seeds do not need to rely on outside sources of nutrients.</p><p>C. Seeds are better protected from environmental dangers than spores are.</p><p>D. Seeds are heavier than spores and are therefore more likely to take root and grow.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BC"><p>BC is based on the chance of survival keyword to locate the fourth sentence. The thus appears at the beginning, and the question is asked why. In the past, the former stated two reasons. The first one had an outer coating and the second one had an outer coating. There is a concentrated supply of nutrient, so the answers are B and C, respectively. The other two answers did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the author mention "a nut", "a peach", and "a cherry"?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To indicate that some seeds are less likely to survive than others</p><p>B. To point out that many angiosperms can be eaten</p><p>C. To provide examples of blooming plants</p><p>D. To illustrate the variety of coverings among angiosperm seeds</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The title of the function, the sentence in which these words are located is an example. In the past, the previous sentence said that the seeds of the angiosperm had a layer of seed coats outside. Then it was said that some skins were hard, such as blabla, and some skins. Is soft, such as blabla, that is, to say that the skin can be divided into different categories to give examples, so D is correct, the other did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">dormant</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. hidden</p><p>B. inactive</p><p>C. underground</p><p>D. preserved</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>Dormant: <span class="question10">dormant</span>, sleeping, static, lurking. A is hidden; B is inactive and idle; C is underground; D is preserved. So B's inactive is correct. Corresponding to the original: They new characteristics offered better ways for the seed to move to new habitats. They could travel through the air, float in water, and lie <span class="question10">dormant</span> for many months. The previous sentence of the original sentence stated that these features made the seeds easier to move to The new location went, and then said that it was able to travel through air, float in water. Since it was moved to a new location, the seeds could not germinate until they arrived at the new location, so they should not be active. Hidden can't see clearly and wrongly, because the front can be seen in the air or in the water; if the ground is in the ground, the seeds can't be moved, so the underground is not right; preserved doesn't fly at all.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, a major reason that coconuts can establish themselves in distant locations is that their seeds can</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. survive long exposure to heat on island beaches</p><p>B. float and survive for long periods in ocean water</p><p>C. use saltwater for maintenance and growth</p><p>D. maintain hard, protective coats even after growing roots</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B: The keyword is positioned as the keyword in the first sentence, but this sentence is obviously irrelevant to the problem and can only be looked down, and the distant location is synonymous with the ocean travel synonymous with the second sentence of the original sentence. Say they can live in the long-term immersion, the correct answer B, note that although C mentioned saltwater, but maintenance and growth did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the passage, which of the following characteristics do spores and seeds have in common?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They may be surrounded by several layers of covering.</p><p>B. They are produced by flowering plants.</p><p>C. They may be spread by wind.</p><p>D. They are able to grow in barren soils.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. The full text of the exam, focusing on the first and last sentence of each paragraph. The first sentence of the second paragraph said that spore could be blown away by the wind. The last sentence of the fourth paragraph stated that the seed could be spread in the air, so the common point of both was C. A and B are the only seeds, spore not; D is only spore, seed does not.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>So since the chances of survival for any individual spore are small, the plants have to produce many spores in order to <span class="question5">propagate</span>..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B Two transition points, many spores and conjunctions so, many spores determine A or B, note that D has no coincidence point with the sentence to be inserted because of the fear spore, and error; after A, there are these plants close to the above transition, exclusion, so B It's correct, and the vast number of them after B happens to be aligned with the many spores in the sentence to be inserted.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>After the formation of the Hawaiian Islands, much time passed before conditions were suitable for plant life.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Algae are classified as symbiotic because they produce energy through the process of photosynthesis.</p><p>B.The first successful plants on Hawaii were probably lichens, which consist of algae and fungi living in a symbiotic relationship.</p><p>C.Lichens helped create favorable conditions for the growth of spore-producing plants such as ferns and mosses.</p><p>D.Seed-bearing plants evolved much later than spore-producing plants, but both types of plants had evolved well before the formation of the Hawaiian Islands.</p><p>E.Unlike spores, seeds must move to new habitats in order to have a strong chance of survival and growth.</p><p>F.Seed-bearing plants arrived and spread quickly in Hawaii, thanks to characteristics that increased their seeds' ability to survive and to move to different areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BCF"><p>The causality of the BCF Algae option was not stated in the original, even if it was a detail, it was not selected. The first option corresponds to the second paragraph from the third sentence to the last part, correct. The Lichens option corresponds to the first two sentences of the original paragraph, correct. Seed-bearing plants evolved option MS corresponds to the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text, but the first sentence of this paragraph is not the center of this paragraph, so this option is a detail, not selected. The original option did not say, do not choose. The Seed-bearing plants arrived option corresponds to the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the original text and the first sentence of the fifth paragraph, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
