Good! <span class="time" data-times="6.6" data-time="138.28">[02:18.28]</span>Wetlands have a big effect on <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water below the surface of the land. <span class="time" data-times="4.44" data-time="144.88">[02:24.88]</span>Think of wetlands as, um, like a <span class="highlight">giant</span><span class="highlight">sponge</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.21" data-time="149.32">[02:29.32]</span>The earth soaks up a lot of this water that's continually flooding the surface, which increases the <span class="highlight">amount</span> of water below. <span class="time" data-times="3.86" data-time="156.53">[02:36.53]</span>So where there are wetlands, you get a lot of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.6" data-time="160.39">[02:40.39]</span>And <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> happens to be a big <span class="highlight">source</span> of our own drinking water today. <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="164.99">[02:44.99]</span>All right, so back to the beavers. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="167.89">[02:47.89]</span>What if the beavers weren't there?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.73" data-time="170.55">[02:50.55]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> student: You just have a <span class="highlight">regular</span> running <span class="highlight">stream</span> 'cause there was no <span class="highlight">dam</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.89" data-time="177.28">[02:57.28]</span>So the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> would be completely different. <span class="time" data-times="1.49" data-time="180.17">[03:00.17]</span>There'd be fewer wetlands.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.54" data-time="181.66">[03:01.66]</span>Professor: Exactly! So now let's go back to where you were headed before, Mike. <span class="time" data-times="4.7" data-time="186.2">[03:06.20]</span>You mentioned a change that occurred after Europeans came to North America.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="190.9">[03:10.90]</span><span class="highlight">Male</span> student: Yeah, well, there used to be beavers all over the place, um, something like two hundred million beavers just in the <span class="highlight">continental</span> United States. <span class="time" data-times="15.2" data-time="199.17">[03:19.17]</span>But when Europeans came, they started hunting the beavers for their <span class="highlight">fur</span>, because <span class="highlight">beaver</span> furs were really warm and it was really <span class="highlight">popular</span> for making hats in Europe, so the beavers were hunted a lot, overhunted; they were almost <span class="highlight">extinct</span> by the 1800s. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="214.37">[03:34.37]</span>So that meant fewer wetlands, less standing water.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="218.65">[03:38.65]</span>Professor: And what does that mean for the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>? Kate?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="13.88" data-time="221.84">[03:41.84]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> student: Well if there's less standing water then the <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> can't support as many <span class="highlight">species</span>, because a lot of the insects and fish and frogs can't live in running water and then the birds and animals that eat them lose their food <span class="highlight">supply</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="235.72">[03:55.72]</span>Professor: Precisely! So the <span class="highlight">beaver</span> in this <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span> is what we called a keystone <span class="highlight">species</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="242.59">[04:02.59]</span>The <span class="highlight">term</span> keystone kind of explains itself. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="246.78">[04:06.78]</span>In <span class="highlight">architecture</span>, a keystone in an archway or doorway is the stone that holds the whole thing together and keeps it from collapsing. <span class="time" data-times="4.49" data-time="254.72">[04:14.72]</span>Well, that's what a keystone <span class="highlight">species</span> does in an <span class="highlight">ecosystem</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.06" data-time="259.21">[04:19.21]</span>It's the <span class="highlight">crucial</span><span class="highlight">species</span> that keeps the system going.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="263.27">[04:23.27]</span>Now, <span class="highlight">beaver</span> populations are on the rise again, but there's something to think about. <span class="time" data-times="3.92" data-time="269.92">[04:29.92]</span><span class="highlight">Consider</span> humans as part of these ecosystems. <span class="time" data-times="9.04" data-time="273.84">[04:33.84]</span>You've probably heard about water shortages or restrictions on how much water you can use, especially in the summer time in recent years. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="282.88">[04:42.88]</span>And remember what I said about <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>, imagine if we still had all those beavers around, all those wetlands, what would our water <span class="highlight">supply</span> be like then?</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the class mainly discussing?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. How beavers select the ecosystem where they live.</p><p>B. How ecosystem differ form on another.</p><p>C. The impact of human activities on an ecosystem.</p><p>D. The role of one species in an ecosystem.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The entire lecture was conducted around beaver (beaver), so choose D. C is not optional, because when it comes to the arrival of human beings, the professor wants to show that the humans killed the beaver and led to the disorder of the ecosystem. The theme is beavers.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor interrupt the student when he first mentions European settlement in North America?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. She had already mentioned that point.</p><p>B. She thinks the information he gave is unrelated to the topic.</p><p>C. She prefers to present the information in the lecture in a specific order.</p><p>D. She questions the accuracy of his point.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>OK, wait, I see where you are heading with this, but before we go into how European settlement affected the ecosystem, tell me this------ what kind of environment do beavers live in?</p><p>The young man wants to talk about Europeans breaking into him when he enters the Americas, and asks young women to explain the ecological environment in which beavers live because young men say it too fast and they do not say what the professor wants to hear. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about still water and swiftly flowing water?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Beavers cannot adapt to living near swiftly flowing water.</p><p>B. Still water and swiftly flowing water support similar ecosystems.</p><p>C. Still water supports more life than swiftly flowing water.</p><p>D. Wetland areas include large quantities of swiftly flowing water.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Wetland areas support a lot more varieties of life than swiftly flowing water.</p><p>The lecture mentioned still water and swiftly flowing water. Since the beavers like to make dams, they blocked the flow of water and formed still water and wetland. This environment can support more fish and shore life, and it can also store more groundwater. Therefore, it can be judged that C is the correct option.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what was the impact of the extensive hunting of beavers in North America?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It led to a decrease in the number of wetlands.</p><p>B. It led to a decrease in the number of swiftly flowing streams.</p><p>C. It led to an increase in the number of other animal species in the wetlands.</p><p>D. It led to an increase in the amount of groundwater.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Beaver itself builds dams, generating still water, generating wetland, species increase, so the number of beavers and wetland should be proportional, so the killing of beavers by European colonists would indirectly lead to a decrease in wetland and a decrease in wetland species. . So option B, C is wrong. Still water helps to store groundwater The decrease in beaver causes still water to decrease, so groundwater reduces D errors. The last correct option is A</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To point out that some terms have different meanings in other fields.</p><p>B. To indicate that she is not going to explain the term.</p><p>C. To defend a point she made earlier about ecosystems.</p><p>D. To clarify a term used in biology.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The term keystone kind of benefit itself. In architecture, a keystone in an archway or doorway is the stone that holds the whole thing together, and keeps it from collapsing.</p><p>The sentence for hard of hearing is an explanation of the meaning of the keystone species, so choose D. The significance of keystone in architecture is almost the same as biology, so A is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor imply when she says this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Beaver dams would cause floods in many areas where people now live.</p><p>B. Beaver dams would cause most of the water supply to be inaccessible.</p><p>C. Large areas of land would become unusable by humans.</p><p>D. More groundwater would be available for human consumption.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Imagine if we still have all those beavers around, all those wetlands. What would our water supply be like then?</p><p>It has been said that beaver can make wetland, and wetland can store groundwater. So if beaver is not killed, then groundwater reserves will increase, and it will not cause the current shortage. So D is correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
