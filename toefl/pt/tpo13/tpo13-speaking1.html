          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>In this item, you should talk about a game or sport in your country that you enjoy. You should describe the activity and explain why you enjoy it. You should be careful not to spend too much of your response time just giving a description of the activity. It is acceptable to explain why the activity is popular in your country, but you should focus mainly on why you enjoy the activity.</p>

          <p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 157.</b></p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>This speaker's response is very clear and well organized. She presents several reasons to support her enjoyment of soccer: it reduces stress, it is good exercise, it encourages cooperation and teamwork. She uses good connecting phrases ()zot only can I lose weight and build self-confidence but! can also learn a sense of cooperation. ."), and she ends her response with a brief summary statement, which makes her point of view clear and memorable. This summary statement does contain some minor grammatical errors ("This is the reasons why! like soccer"), and she does have some noticeable pauses throughout her response. Overall, however, none of these errors make her response difficult to follow. </p>

          <p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 158.</b></p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>This response is mostly intelligible, but the first sentence is very difficult to understand. The speaker's topic is dear, and she does explain why she enjoys football. (Note: this speaker uses the term football, while the previous speaker uses soccer. Either is acceptable.) Her reasons for enjoying football, however, are mostly related to teamwork, and so she actually repeats herself for most of the response ("we have to play as a group, it's enjoyable because everyone has to support the team. You have to try to play with the people and have contact with your teammates"). She pauses often, clearly searching for the right words. She also has some noticeable grammatical errors ("it's a game that requires the playing in together"), and she makes some consistent pronunciation errors (pronouncing "very' as "berry"), though she is still relatively easy to understand. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Basketball is one group activity that is played in my country. It's enjoyable because people can relax and get exercise from playing basketball. Almost every community in my country has a basketball court and every afternoon adults after work and children after school come to play together. Adults play to relax and to get rid of the tiring work in the morning, while some kids come to play for fun and exercise. Some kids enjoy throwing balls into the basket. Some enjoy running around, dribbling and chasing the one with the ball.</p>
