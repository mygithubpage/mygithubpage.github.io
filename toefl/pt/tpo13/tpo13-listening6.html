I want to go over the different types of meteorites and what we've learned about them from the <span class="highlight">formation</span> of earth and the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system. <span class="time" data-times="15.36" data-time="13.3">[00:13.30]</span>Uh, the thing is, what's especially interesting about meteorites is that they come from <span class="highlight">interplanetary</span><span class="highlight">space</span>, but they <span class="highlight">consist</span> of the same chemical elements that are in matter originating on earth, just in different proportions.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.27" data-time="28.66">[00:28.66]</span>But that makes it easier to <span class="highlight">identify</span> something as a <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to just a <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> rock. <span class="time" data-times="17.06" data-time="36.93">[00:36.93]</span>So to talk about where meteorites come from, we need to talk about comets and asteroids, which basically, they are basically made up of <span class="highlight">debris</span> left over from the <span class="highlight">origin</span> of the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system 4.6 billion years ago. <span class="time" data-times="3.58" data-time="53.99">[00:53.99]</span>Now I'm going a little out of order here, um. <span class="time" data-times="7.56" data-time="57.57">[00:57.57]</span>I'm not going to go into any depth on comets and asteroids now, but we will come back later and do that.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.29" data-time="65.13">[01:05.13]</span>For now, I'll just cover some <span class="highlight">basic</span> info about them. <span class="time" data-times="11.57" data-time="69.42">[01:09.42]</span>OK, comets and asteroids, it might help if you think of, remember we talked about the two classes of planets in our <span class="highlight">solar</span> system? <span class="time" data-times="3.12" data-time="80.99">[01:20.99]</span>And how they differ in <span class="highlight">composition</span>? <span class="time" data-times="6.75" data-time="84.11">[01:24.11]</span>The <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets like Mars and Earth, composed largely of rocks and metals? <span class="time" data-times="4.11" data-time="90.86">[01:30.86]</span>And the large gas giants like <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>? <span class="time" data-times="18.66" data-time="94.97">[01:34.97]</span>Well, the <span class="highlight">solar</span> system also has two <span class="highlight">analogous</span> classes of objects smaller than planets, namely asteroids and comets, <span class="highlight">relatively</span> near the Sun, in the <span class="highlight">inner</span><span class="highlight">solar</span> system between <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span> and Mars to be <span class="highlight">precise</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="113.63">[01:53.63]</span>We've got the <span class="highlight">asteroid</span><span class="highlight">belt</span>, which contains about 90 percent of all asteroids orbiting the Sun.<span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="120.82">[02:00.82]</span>These asteroids are, uh, like the <span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> planets in that they are composed mostly of <span class="highlight">rocky</span><span class="highlight">material</span> and metals. <span class="time" data-times="15.36" data-time="130.59">[02:10.59]</span>Far from the Sun, in the outer <span class="highlight">solar</span> system, beyond <span class="highlight">Jupiter</span>'s <span class="highlight">orbit</span>, temperatures are low enough to <span class="highlight">permit</span> ices to form out of water and, and out of gases like, uh, <span class="highlight">methane</span> and <span class="highlight">carbon</span><span class="highlight">dioxide</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.42" data-time="145.95">[02:25.95]</span><span class="highlight">Loose</span> collections of these ices and small <span class="highlight">rocky</span> particles form into comets. <span class="time" data-times="5.49" data-time="152.37">[02:32.37]</span>So comets are <span class="highlight">similar</span> in <span class="highlight">composition</span> to the gas giants.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="157.86">[02:37.86]</span>Both comets and asteroids are, typically are smaller than planets. <span class="time" data-times="6.11" data-time="164.6">[02:44.60]</span>And <span class="highlight">even</span> smaller type of <span class="highlight">interplanetary</span><span class="highlight">debris</span> is the meteoroid. <span class="time" data-times="5.17" data-time="170.71">[02:50.71]</span>And it's from the meteoroids that we get meteors and meteorites. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="175.88">[02:55.88]</span>Roids are, for the most part anyway, they're just smaller bits of asteroids and comets.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="9.72" data-time="182.46">[03:02.46]</span>When these bits enter earth's <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>, well, that makes them so <span class="highlight">special</span> that they get a <span class="highlight">special</span> name: they're called meteors. <span class="time" data-times="6.29" data-time="192.18">[03:12.18]</span>Most of them are very small and they burn up soon after entering earth's <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.87" data-time="198.47">[03:18.47]</span>The larger ones that make it <span class="highlight">through</span> the <span class="highlight">atmosphere</span> and hit the ground are called meteorites. <span class="time" data-times="4.57" data-time="205.34">[03:25.34]</span>So meteorites are the ones that actually make it <span class="highlight">through</span>.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.01" data-time="209.91">[03:29.91]</span>Now, we've been finding meteorites on earth for thousands of years. <span class="time" data-times="8.98" data-time="213.92">[03:33.92]</span>And we've analyzed enough of them to learn a lot about their <span class="highlight">composition</span>, most come from asteroids, though a few may have come from comets. <span class="time" data-times="2.51" data-time="222.9">[03:42.90]</span>So, <span class="highlight">essentially</span>, they are rocks. <span class="time" data-times="3" data-time="225.41">[03:45.41]</span>And like rocks, they are mixtures of minerals. <span class="time" data-times="9.1" data-time="228.41">[03:48.41]</span>They are generally classified into three <span class="highlight">broad</span> categories: stones, stony irons and irons.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="8.22" data-time="237.51">[03:57.51]</span>Stone meteorites, which we <span class="highlight">refer</span> to <span class="highlight">simply</span> as, uh, stones, are almost <span class="highlight">entirely</span> rock <span class="highlight">material</span>. <span class="time" data-times="5.41" data-time="245.73">[04:05.73]</span>They actually <span class="highlight">account</span> for almost all of the <span class="highlight">meteorite</span><span class="highlight">material</span> that falls to earth. <span class="time" data-times="4.23" data-time="251.14">[04:11.14]</span>But <span class="highlight">even</span> so, it's <span class="highlight">rare</span> to ever find one. <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="255.37">[04:15.37]</span>I mean, it's easier to find an iron <span class="highlight">meteorite</span> or stony iron. <span class="time" data-times="2.29" data-time="260.39">[04:20.39]</span>Any one guess why? <span class="time" data-times="1.91" data-time="262.68">[04:22.68]</span>Look at their names. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="264.59">[04:24.59]</span>What do you think iron meteorites <span class="highlight">consist</span> of?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.41" data-time="267.78">[04:27.78]</span><span class="highlight">Female</span> student: Mostly iron?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="4.47" data-time="269.19">[04:29.19]</span>Professor: Yeah! Iron and some <span class="highlight">nickel</span>, both of which are metals. <span class="time" data-times="2.61" data-time="273.66">[04:33.66]</span>And if you're trying to find metal?</p><p><span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="276.27">[04:36.27]</span>Student: Oh, metal detectors!</p><p><span class="time" data-times="1.36" data-time="278.57">[04:38.57]</span>Professor: Right! Thank you! <span class="time" data-times="2.05" data-time="279.93">[04:39.93]</span>At <span class="highlight">least</span> that's part of it. <span class="time" data-times="14.88" data-time="281.98">[04:41.98]</span>Stone meteorites, if they lie around <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to the weather for a few years, well, they're made of rock, so they end up looking almost indistinguishable from <span class="highlight">common</span><span class="highlight">terrestrial</span> rocks, ones that originated on earth. <span class="time" data-times="2.92" data-time="296.86">[04:56.86]</span>So it's hard to <span class="highlight">spot</span> them by eye.</p><p><span class="time" data-times="3.82" data-time="299.78">[04:59.78]</span>But we can use metal detectors to help us find the others. <span class="time" data-times="2.44" data-time="303.6">[05:03.60]</span>And they are easier to <span class="highlight">spot</span> by eye. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="306.04">[05:06.04]</span>So most of the meteorites in collections, uh, in museums, they'll be, they are iron meteorites, or the stony iron kind, <span class="highlight">even</span> though they only make up about 5 percent of the <span class="highlight">meteorite</span><span class="highlight">material</span> on the ground.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the main topic of the lecture?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The major differences between meteors and meteorites.</p><p>B. The origins of comets and asteroids.</p><p>C. The nature and origin of meteorites.</p><p>D. The similarities between objects in the inner solar system.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>OK, I wanna go over the different types of meteorites, and what we've learned from them about the formation of Earth, and the solar system</p><p>Also in the beginning of the lecture to find the answer, this question has some tricky, the beginning of the professor said to talk about different types of meteoroids, but later used a large space to explain its origin, and then gave the meteoroid classification, and finally talked about Meteorite, and categorized it, so in fact the main topic of the lecture is meteorite. The other options are too minor. So choose C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What comparison does the professor make to help describe the composition of asteroids and comets?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He compares them to stars.</p><p>B. He compares them to types of planets.</p><p>C. He compares them to rocks on Earth.</p><p>D. He compares them to meteors and meteorites.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Remember we talked about the two classes of planets in our solar system? And how they differ in composition?</p><p>The professor used the two planets in the planetary system to distinguish between rocks A and C: solid and gas planets for comparison.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor say about the origin of meteors and meteorites?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are pieces of asteroids or comets.</p><p>B. They are pieces of the planets in our solar system.</p><p>C. They are made from minerals that are otherwise uncommon in our solar system.</p><p>D. Their origin cannot be determined.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>"Roids" are, for the most part anyway, they are just smaller bits of asteroids and comets. When it comes to the origins of meteors and meteorites, they mention just smaller bits of asteroids and comets." So the answer is A.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor,what feature of a meteoroid generally determines whether the meteoroid becomes a meteorite?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Whether it was originally part of a larger meteoroid.</p><p>B. Whether it originated in the inner or outer solar system.</p><p>C. What proportion of iron and stone it contains.</p><p>D. How large it is when it enters the Earth's atmosphere.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The larger ones that make it through the atmosphere and hit the ground are called meteorites.</p><p>Meteoroid is a meteor body. There are two categories under this category, meteor and meteorite. The difference between the two is size, the latter is larger.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are two points the professor makes about stone meteorites? Click on 2 answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They are the type of meteorite that most commonly falls to the ground.</p><p>B. They are type of meteorite most often seen in museums.</p><p>C. They are the oldest type of meteorite found on the ground.</p><p>D. They are the most difficult type of meteorite to find on the ground.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>They actually account for almost all of the meteorite material that falls to earth. (A) Stone meteorites, if they lie around exposed to the weather for a few years, well, they're made of rock, so they end up looking almost indistinguishable From common terrestrial rocks--ones that originated on earth. (D) Correspondingly, most of the meteorites that land on the earth are of the stone type, but they are still very rare. Just corresponds to the AD option.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor say this?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To offer a hint about the answer to a question he asked.</p><p>B. To clarify a question that a student asked.</p><p>C. To find out whether students understand question he asked.</p><p>D. To find out whether students understand an important comparison he made.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The professor throws out a half sentence, then raises the tone, that is, the tone of the question, is guiding the student to answer the latter part of the sentence, the student did answer: "Oh! Metal detectors!" So A is the correct option, hint (hint) . The professor is not a declarative sentence, does not state any facts, and answers any questions, so B is wrong; heavy hearing is a problem, not a confirmation of a question that has already been asked, so C is wrong; although there are indeed stony and iron in the original text. Contrast, but hard of hearing is not to confirm whether the students understand the contrast, but to guide students in their association, must not be obscene, so the answer D is wrong.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
