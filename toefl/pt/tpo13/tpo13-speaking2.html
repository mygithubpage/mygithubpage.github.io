Others prefer to mainly use printed materials such as books and academic journals. Which do you prefer and why?</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>Speakers should both state their preference and provide support for their choice, such as preferring the internet because it allows for faster research, or preferring printed materials because they are more reliable sources. There are many ways to successfully support a choke. Speakers may provide one overarching reason and elaborate on it, or provide several different reasons. They may provide concrete examples or general logic. It is also acceptable for speakers to say they find both internet and printed materials useful in doing research, but speakers would need to clearly explain why and under what circumstances each type of source is appropriate, and this would be difficult for many speakers to do in the time given. In all cases, the listener should be able to easily follow why the speaker holds that opinion. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I prefer to use Internet to look for information for the following two reasons. First, it's very fast to find the information from Internet. Since now we have many search engines such as Google and Bing, we just need to input key words and the results will be listed on the screen. From the results, we can always find the information related to the research project. Second, Internet has way more information than do printed materials. Nearly all printed materials now have e-version online.With may scientific databases, we can always find what we need by title, author or even content. So, when we are doing research project, Internet is more convenient than printed materials.</p></article></div><div><p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 159.</b></p><p><audio src="track_159.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker dearly states his preference (using the internet to find information for a research project) and why he prefers it ("because you have a wider range of infonnationfroni the internet"). He then goes on to elaborate on his reasons, explaining why printed materials are not as convenient ("you need a particular type of information you need to go and search for a particular journal") and comparing them to the internet. Although he does not give specific examples, his reasons are full and clear. The lack of examples is acceptable since this particular prompt did not ask for them. A noticeable accent and occasional mispronunciations do not prevent the listener from easily understanding the response. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 160.</b></p><p><audio src="track_160.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker states her preference ("(prefer to research some information from the internet") and provides some support for her choice ("It is easier and faster to access some informations"). However, beyond that initial statement, only a moderate amount of relevant support is provided. The speaker has some language limitations that prevent her from providing full support: she speaks slowly and with hesitation, and does not successfully use a wide variety of vocabulary or grammatical structures. She also includes information whose relevance is not clear. For example, she says, "I can not only save my time, but also exchange opinions with others easily." It is not obvious what exchanging opinions with others has to do with getting information for a research project, and the speaker does not explain the connection. </p></div></main></body></html>
