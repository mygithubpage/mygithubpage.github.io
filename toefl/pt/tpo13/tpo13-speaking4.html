An object viewed from one angle presents a different shapes to our eye than when viewed from another angle; similarity, as the distance from which we view an object changes, the object will appear larger or smaller. In spite of this, even as conditions change and we see objects differently, we still recognize that they remain the same. This is what is known as perceptual constancy. If not for perceptual constancy, we might have difficulty recognizing familiar objects if we viewed them in a new and different context.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo13-speaking4.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class.</p><p>(Male Professor) Let's take an everyday example an ordinary round plate like you'd find in a kitchen. If you hold the plate directly in front of your face and look at it, what shape do you see? A perfect circle, right?Suppose you tilt the plate to a different angle, to a horizontal position, like you're planning to put food on it, still a perfect circle? No! The circle is now stretched out, flattened into an oval. Do you conclude the plate had actually changed shape? Or that it's a different object, not the same plate? Of course not! It looks different, but we perceive it as still being the same.Here's a different example. This classroom we're in. It's fairly large, right? Now, from up close, from the front row, I appear to be relatively big, bigger than if you're in the last row, right? But let's say you're sitting in the front row today but tomorrow you're sitting in the back row. From back there I''m going to look smaller, but you don't think I've actually gotten smaller. Yo u don't think you're seeing a different professor, a guy who looks like me except he's smaller. No matter where you are, up close or far away, you understand without even thinking about it, that I'm the same size, the same person.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Explain what is meant by perceptual constancy using the examples provided by the professor. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>This task asks you to explain how the examples given by the professor in the lecture illustrate the concept of perceptual constancy from the reading. There are different ways you can organize your response. You might begin by explaining that perceptual constancy is the idea that even though objects appear different depending on external conditions, we are able to recognize that they are the same objects. Or you might choose to begin with the examples and conclude with a summary of the theory of perceptual constancy. Either approach is acceptable, but you should be sure to include both examples in your response (a plate may look round or oval depending on the angle from which we look at it, but we still recognize it as a plate; and the professor may appear smaller when viewed from the back of the room [instead of the front], but we still understand that the professor is the same person, and that he has not gotten smaller). </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Perceptual constancy is the phenomenon that however the external conditions affect our perception of an object, we still recognize it. According to the professor, there're two examples of this. The first one is about angle. When you hold a plate upright to your face, you see a perfect circle. But if a plate is placed horizontally, it stretches out, and flattens into an oval. Anyway, no matter what shape we see, we always know that it's the same plate because of perceptual constancy. Another example is about distance. We all know that if someone is far away from us, he/she appears smaller. Otherwise he/she appears bigger and taller. So if a student sits in the front row, he'll see a bigger and taller professor. But if he sits in the back, he will see a smaller professor. Bigger or smaller he still knows that it's the same professor due to perceptual constancy.

She explains the examples from the lecture first, and defines the concept later. This is a different but effective approach to answering the prompt. Her word choice and expression is not always perfect. For example, when defining the concept of perceptual constancy she says, "we know by distance and angle . . . it doesn't look the same." This is a somewhat vague statement. She could have used a clearer and more complex sentence like, "Even though an object looks different when viewed from a different angle or distance, we know it is the same object." Nevertheless, her delivery is fluid, and she is able to construct long, clear phrases in the explanation of the examples a... a professor in a front row, he looks bigger than you see the professor in the back row, but . . without even thinking you know that it's the same professor, and the same guy who's lecturing." </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 164.</b></p><p><audio src="track_164.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker covers most of the information required of the task, but his response is not as clear or efficient as that of the high-level speaker. His word choice is imprecise and at times causes difficulty for the listener. For instance, he says, "... perceptual constancy means you may remain same ideas when looking at something from different aspects." The phrase "You may remain same ideas" is not grammatically correct and the use of the term "ideas" is rather vague in meaning. The speaker could have more accurately expressed the idea as "continue to recognize an object." Also, he uses the word "aspect" instead of "angle" or "perspective7 which is confusing for the listener. The speaker's pronunciation is relatively clear, but he repeats words and phrases often, which is at times distracting and requires some effort from the listener to follow his response. Overall, there is some evidence that he understood the reading and lecture, but limitations in grammar and vocabulary prevent him from expressing some of the ideas clearly. </p></div></main></body></html>
