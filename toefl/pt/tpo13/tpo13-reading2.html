The relations between animal <span class="highlight">activity</span> and these periods, particularly for the daily rhythms, have been of such <span class="highlight">interest</span> and importance that a huge <span class="highlight">amount</span> of work has been done on them and the <span class="highlight">special</span> research <span class="highlight">field</span> of chronobiology has emerged. <span class="highlight">Normally</span>, the <span class="highlight">constantly</span> changing levels of an animal's <span class="highlight">activity</span>-sleeping, feeding, moving, reproducing, metabolizing, and producing enzymes and hormones, for example-are well coordinated with <span class="highlight">environmental</span> rhythms, but the key question is whether the animal's <span class="highlight">schedule</span> is driven by <span class="highlight">external</span> cues, such as sunrise or <span class="highlight">sunset</span>, or is <span class="highlight">instead</span> dependent somehow on <span class="highlight">internal</span> timers that themselves <span class="highlight">generate</span> the observed biological rhythms. Almost universally, biologists accept the idea that all eukaryotes (a <span class="highlight">category</span> that includes most organisms except <span class="highlight">bacteria</span> and certain <span class="highlight">algae</span>) have <span class="highlight">internal</span> clocks. By isolating organisms completely from <span class="highlight">external</span><span class="highlight">periodic</span> cues, biologists learned that organisms have <span class="highlight">internal</span> clocks. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, apparently normal daily periods of biological <span class="highlight">activity</span> were maintained for about a week by the <span class="highlight">fungus</span> Neurospora when it was <span class="highlight">intentionally</span><span class="highlight">isolated</span> from all geophysical timing cues while orbiting in a <span class="highlight">space</span><span class="highlight">shuttle</span>. The <span class="highlight">continuation</span> of biological rhythms in an <span class="highlight">organism</span> without <span class="highlight">external</span> cues attests to its having an <span class="highlight">internal</span> clock.</p><p>When crayfish are kept continuously in the dark, <span class="highlight">even</span> for four to five months, their <span class="highlight">compound</span> eyes continue to <span class="highlight">adjust</span> on a daily <span class="highlight">schedule</span> for daytime and nighttime <span class="highlight">vision</span>. Horseshoe crabs kept in the dark continuously for a year were found to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight"><span class="question4">persistent</span></span><span class="highlight">rhythm</span> of brain <span class="highlight">activity</span> that similarly adapts their eyes on a daily <span class="highlight">schedule</span> for bright or for weak light. Like almost all daily cycles of animals deprived of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> cues, those measured for the horseshoe crabs in these conditions were not exactly 24 hours. Such a <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> whose period is <span class="highlight">approximately</span>-but not exactly-a day is called circadian. For different <span class="highlight">individual</span> horseshoe crabs, the circadian period ranged from 22.2 to 25.5 hours. A <span class="highlight">particular</span> animal typically maintains its own <span class="highlight">characteristic</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question9">duration</span></span> with great precision for many days. <span class="question5">Indeed, <span class="highlight">stability</span> of the biological clock's period is one of its <span class="highlight">major</span> features, <span class="highlight">even</span> when the <span class="highlight">organism</span>'s environment is subjected to <span class="highlight">considerable</span> changes in factors, such as <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, that would be expected to <span class="highlight">affect</span> biological <span class="highlight">activity</span> strongly.</span> Further <span class="highlight">evidence</span> for <span class="highlight">persistent</span><span class="highlight">internal</span> rhythms appears when the usual <span class="highlight">external</span> cycles are shifted-either experimentally or by rapid east-west travel over great distances. Typically, the animal's daily internally generated <span class="highlight">cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">activity</span> continues without change. As a result, its activities are shifted <span class="highlight">relative</span> to the <span class="highlight">external</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span> of the new environment. The disorienting effects of this mismatch between <span class="highlight">external</span> time cues and <span class="highlight">internal</span> schedules may <span class="highlight">persist</span>, like our jet lag, for several days or weeks until certain cues such as the daylight/darkness <span class="highlight">cycle</span> reset the <span class="highlight">organism</span>'s clock to <span class="highlight">synchronize</span> with the daily <span class="highlight">rhythm</span> of the new environment.</p><p>Animals need natural <span class="highlight">periodic</span> signals like sunrise to <span class="highlight">maintain</span> a <span class="highlight">cycle</span> whose period is precisely 24 hours. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Such an <span class="highlight">external</span><span class="highlight">cue</span> not only 
coordinates an animal's daily rhythms with <span class="highlight">particular</span> features of the <span class="highlight">local</span><span class="highlight">solar</span> day but also-because <span class="question11">it</span><span class="highlight">normally</span> does so day after day-seems to keep
the <span class="highlight">internal</span> clock's period close to that of  Earth's <span class="highlight">rotation</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Yet despite this <span class="highlight">synchronization</span> of the period of the <span class="highlight">internal</span><span class="highlight">cycle</span>, the animal's timer 
itself continues to have its own <span class="highlight">genetically</span> built-in period close to, but different from, 24 hours. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Without the <span class="highlight">external</span><span class="highlight">cue</span>, the <span class="highlight">difference</span> accumulates and so 
the internally regulated activities of the biological day <span class="highlight">drift</span> continuously, like the tides, in relation to the <span class="highlight">solar</span> day. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>This <span class="highlight">drift</span> has been studied extensively in 
many animals and in biological activities ranging from the hatching of fruit fly eggs to wheel running by squirrels. Light has a predominating influence in <span class="highlight">setting</span> the clock.
<span class="highlight">Even</span> a fifteen-minute burst of light in <span class="highlight">otherwise</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question12">sustained</span></span> darkness can reset an animal's circadian <span class="highlight">rhythm</span>. <span class="highlight">Normally</span>, <span class="highlight">internal</span> rhythms are kept in step by <span class="highlight">regular</span><span class="highlight">environmental</span> cycles.
For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, if a <span class="highlight">homing</span><span class="highlight">pigeon</span> is to <span class="highlight">navigate</span> with its Sun <span class="highlight">compass</span>, its clock must be properly set by cues provided by the daylight/darkness <span class="highlight">cycle</span>.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">Consequently</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Therefore</p><p>B. Additionally</p><p>C. Nevertheless</p><p>D. Moreover</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A eyes: So, so. A is therefore; B is extra; C is however; D is and, in addition. So A's therefore is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, the experiment on the fungus Neurospora is mentioned to illustrate</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the existence of weekly periods of activity as well as daily ones</p><p>B. the finding of evidence that organisms have internal clocks</p><p>C. the effect of space on the internal clocks of organisms</p><p>D. the isolation of one part of an organism's cycle for study</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The topic of the function, N, is an example, and there is a for example in the beginning of the sentence. This sentence is an example of the previous sentence. Look forward to: By isolating organisms completely from external periodic cues, Biologists learned that organisms have internal clocks. After we completely isolate the living things from external conditions, we can discover the internal rhythms of the creatures, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, all the following are generally assumed to be true EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is important for animals' daily activities to be coordinated with recurring events in their environment.</p><p>B. Eukaryotes have internal clocks.</p><p>C. The relationship between biological function and environmental cycles is a topic of intense research.</p><p>D. Animals' daily rhythms are more dependent on external cues than on internal clocks.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A activities and coordinates do keyword positioning to the first sentence, correct, not selected; B's E keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, clearly pointed out internal, so correct, not selected; C's intense research to do keyword Positioning to the third sentence, correct, not selected; D's comparison of the original did not say, wrong, choose.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">persistent</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. adjusted</p><p>B. strong</p><p>C. enduring</p><p>D. predicted</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C persistent: Continuous. A is adjusted; B is strong; C is continuous; D is predictive. So C's enduring is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Stability, a feature of the biological clock's period, depends on changeable factors such as temperature.</p><p>B. A major feature of the biological clock is that its period does not change despite significant changes in the environment.</p><p>C. A factor such as temperature is an important feature in the establishment of the biological clock's period.</p><p>D. Biological activity is not strongly affected by changes in temperature.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The main logic of B original sentence is concession, the structure is: Stability is one of the main features, even if the environment will suffer from many factors. Among them, such as the insert component of this example, you can completely ignore it. B is exactly the same, and it is the correct answer. A's depend is purely fabricated; both C and D completely change the original text's stem, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is true about the circadian periods of animals deprived of environmental cues?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They have the same length as the daily activity cycles of animals that are not deprived of such cues.</p><p>B. They can vary significantly from day to day.</p><p>C. They are not the same for all members of a single species.</p><p>D. They become longer over time.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Take the circadian keyword as the key word to the fourth sentence, because this sentence is a such as the beginning, indicating that it may be related to the previous sentence. Read these two sentences and say that if there is no environmental cue, the horseshoe crab's period is not 24 hours. The 24 hours is called circadian. Then the article says that it may be 22.2 to 25.5 hours. So the answer is C. The circadian of the same species is not the same. This question is apt to misselect A, because the previous article emphasizes that there is no external environment factor when circadian is not 24 hours, so not same, A wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, what will an animal experience when its internal rhythms no longer correspond with the daily cycle of the environment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Disorientation</p><p>B. Change in period of the internal rhythms</p><p>C. Reversal of day and night activities increased</p><p>D. Sensitivity to environmental factors</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The word "cycle of the environment" is used to locate the second last sentence of the sentence. The sentence says that the internal rhythm of the creature does not change. Then the activity of the creature has to change because of the new environment, and then there is a miscatch. Disorientation is the correct answer. B is contrary to the original, C and D did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, the author provides evidence for the role of biological clocks by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. listing the daily activities of an animal's cycle: sleeping, feeding, moving, reproducing, metabolizing, and producing enzymes and hormones</p><p>B. describing the process of establishing the period of a biological clock</p><p>C. presenting cases in which an animal's daily schedule remained stable despite lack of environmental cues</p><p>D. contrasting animals whose daily schedules fluctuate with those of animals whose schedules are constant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C asks the author how to give the role of the biological clock. It is not easy to locate the answer and use the exclusion method. A said that listed the animal's cyclical activities, but simply listed activities can not play a role in explaining the role of the biological clock, too shallow, not right; the original does not describe the formation of the biological clock, B wrong; C corresponds to the original penultimate sentence (sentence simplified question That sentence), said that there is no external environmental conditions can still work biological clock, indicating that the biological clock plays an important role, do not rely on other, so C is the answer; D's two did not say the original comparison, do not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">duration</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. length</p><p>B. feature</p><p>C. process</p><p>D. repetition</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question9">duration</span>: Duration. A is the length, B is the feature, C is the process, and D is the repetition. So the length of A is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author mention that the period for different horseshoe crabs ranges from 22.2 to 25.5 hours?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To illustrate that an animal's internal clock seldom has a 24-hour cycle</p><p>B. To argue that different horseshoe crabs will shift from daytime to nighttime vision at different times</p><p>C. To illustrate the approximate range of the circadian rhythm of all animals</p><p>D. To support the idea that external cues are the only factors affecting an animal's periodic behavior</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>For the rhetorical question, first look at the sentence under which the number lies, and say that the circadian of different horseshoe crabs is between 22.2 and 25.5 hours, which is obviously just an example. The first sentence says that the 24-hour, but not accurate, 24-hour rhythm is called circadian, which means that the latter sentence is an example of a 24-hour circadian being inaccurate, so the answer is A. B shift from daytime to nighttime did not say; C and D are too absolute and the original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">it</span>" in the passage refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. an external cue such as sunrise</p><p>B. the daily rhythm of an animal</p><p>C. the local solar day</p><p>D. a cycle whose period is precisely 24 hours</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A refers to, looking forward, looking for a noun, because there is also, in front there must be not only, and not only and but also share the same subject, so the subject before not only is the answer A of this question.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">sustained</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. intense</p><p>B. uninterrupted</p><p>C. natural</p><p>D. periodic</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B,<span class="question12">sustained</span>: Lasting, lasting. A is strong; B is uninterrupted; <span class="question12">sustained</span> is maintained, continuous, so B's uninterrupted correctness.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Because the internal signals that regulate waking and going to sleep tend to align themselves with these external cues, the external clock appears to dominate the internal clock..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The two transition points, the pronouns these means that the correct insertion point must have the following noun external cues, so B and D may be the answer, but this drift after D is closely related to the previous drift, so the answer is B. And to be inserted sentence said internal dominate external, immediately followed by B said this synchronization, this synchronization corresponds to the sentence to be inserted, also shows that B is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
The activity of animals is usually coordinated with periodically recurring events in the environment.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.Most animals survive and reproduce successfully without coordinating their activities to external environmental rhythms.</p><p>B.The circadian period of an animal's internal clock is genetically determined and basically unchangeable.</p><p>C.Environmental cues such as a change in temperature are enough to reset an animal's clock.</p><p>D.Animals have internal clocks that influence their activities even when environmental cues are absent.</p><p>E.Animals are less affected by large differences between their internal rhythms and the local solar day than are humans.</p><p>F.Because an animal's internal clock does not operate on a 24-hour cycle, environmental stimuli are needed to keep the biological day aligned with the solar day.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BDF"><p>The most option is contrary to the last sentence in the first paragraph of the original text. The meaning of the original text is that there is a rhythm to prove the existence of the biological clock regardless of the existence of external conditions. The circadian option corresponds to the fourth sentence of the second paragraph of the original text, correct, pay attention to this particular, the central sentence is not in front of the back and not in the middle. The environmental option is contrary to the content of the seventh sentence of the second paragraph of the original text. The animal have option corresponds to the second paragraph of the original text, correct. Animal are the options did not say, do not choose. The because option corresponds to the first sentence of the third paragraph of the original text, correct.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
