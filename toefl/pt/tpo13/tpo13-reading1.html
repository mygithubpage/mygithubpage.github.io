Our humanness arises out of these relationships in the <span class="highlight">course</span> of social <span class="highlight">interaction</span>. Moreover, our humanness must be <span class="highlight">sustained</span><span class="highlight">through</span> social <span class="highlight">interaction</span>-and <span class="highlight">fairly</span><span class="highlight">constantly</span> so. When an <span class="highlight">association</span> continues long enough for two people to become linked together by a <span class="highlight">relatively</span><span class="highlight">stable</span> set of expectations, it is called a relationship.</p><p>People are <span class="highlight">bound</span><span class="highlight">within</span> relationships by two types of bonds: <span class="highlight">expressive</span> ties and <span class="highlight">instrumental</span> ties. <span class="highlight">Expressive</span> ties are social links formed when we emotionally invest ourselves in and <span class="highlight">commit</span> ourselves to other people. <span class="highlight">Through</span><span class="highlight">association</span> with people who are <span class="highlight">meaningful</span> to us, we achieve a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of <span class="highlight">security</span>, love, acceptance, companionship, and <span class="highlight">personal</span><span class="highlight">worth</span>. <span class="highlight">Instrumental</span> ties are social links formed when we cooperate with other people to achieve some goal. Occasionally, this may mean working with <span class="highlight">instead</span> of against competitors. More often, we <span class="highlight">simply</span> cooperate with others to <span class="highlight">reach</span> some end without <span class="question3">endowing</span> the relationship with any larger <span class="highlight">significance</span>.</p><p>Sociologists have built on the <span class="highlight">distinction</span> between <span class="highlight">expressive</span> and <span class="highlight">instrumental</span> ties to <span class="highlight">distinguish</span> between two types of groups: <span class="highlight">primary</span> and secondary. A <span class="highlight">primary</span> group involves two or more people who enjoy a direct, <span class="highlight">intimate</span>, cohesive relationship with one another. <span class="highlight">Expressive</span> ties <span class="highlight">predominate</span> in <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups; we view the people as ends in themselves and <span class="highlight">valuable</span> in their own right. A secondary group entails two or more people who are involved in an <span class="highlight">impersonal</span> relationship and have come together for a <span class="highlight">specific</span>, <span class="highlight">practical</span> purpose. <span class="highlight">Instrumental</span> ties <span class="highlight">predominate</span> in secondary groups; we <span class="highlight">perceive</span> people as means to ends rather than as ends in their own right. Sometimes <span class="highlight">primary</span> group relationships <span class="highlight">evolve</span> out of secondary group relationships. This happens in many work settings. People on the job often develop close relationships with coworkers as they come to share gripes, jokes, gossip, and satisfactions.</p><p>A number of conditions <span class="highlight">enhance</span> the likelihood that <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups will arise. First, group size is important. We find it difficult to get to know people personally when they are milling about and dispersed in large groups. In small groups we have a better <span class="highlight">chance</span> to <span class="highlight">initiate</span><span class="highlight">contact</span> and <span class="highlight">establish</span><span class="highlight">rapport</span> with them. <span class="highlight">Second</span>, face-to-face <span class="highlight">contact</span> allows us to <span class="question7">size up</span> others. Seeing and talking with one another in close <span class="highlight">physical</span><span class="highlight">proximity</span> makes possible a <span class="highlight">subtle</span><span class="highlight">exchange</span> of ideas and feelings. And third, the probability that we will develop <span class="highlight">primary</span> group bonds increases as we have frequent and <span class="highlight">continuous</span><span class="highlight">contact</span>. Our ties with people often deepen as we <span class="highlight">interact</span> with them <span class="highlight">across</span> time and <span class="highlight">gradually</span><span class="highlight">evolve</span> interlocking habits and interests.</p><p><span class="highlight">Primary</span> groups are <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> to us and to society. First, <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups are <span class="highlight">critical</span> to the socialization <span class="highlight">process</span>. <span class="highlight">Within</span> them, infants and children are introduced to the ways of their society. Such groups are the <span class="highlight">breeding</span> grounds in which we <span class="highlight">acquire</span> the norms and values that equip us for social life. <span class="question8">Sociologists view <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups as bridges between individuals and the larger society because they <span class="highlight">transmit</span>, <span class="highlight">mediate</span>, and <span class="highlight">interpret</span> a society's cultural patterns and provide the <span class="highlight">sense</span> of oneness so <span class="highlight">critical</span> for social solidarity.</span></p><p><span class="highlight">Second</span>, <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups are <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> because they provide the settings in which we meet most of our <span class="highlight">personal</span> needs.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span><span class="highlight">Within</span> them, we experience companionship, love, <span class="highlight">security</span>,
and an <span class="highlight">overall</span><span class="highlight">sense</span> of well-being.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Not surprisingly, sociologists find that the strength of a group's <span class="highlight">primary</span> ties has implications for the group's functioning.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>For example, the stronger the <span class="highlight">primary</span> group ties of a sports team playing together, the better their <span class="highlight">record</span> is.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p><p>Third, <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups are <span class="highlight">fundamental</span> because they serve as powerful instruments for social control. Their members <span class="highlight">command</span> and <span class="highlight">dispense</span> many of the rewards that are so <span class="highlight">vital</span> to us and that make our lives <span class="highlight">seem</span><span class="highlight">worthwhile</span>. Should the use of rewards fail, members can frequently win by rejecting or threatening to ostracize those who <span class="highlight"><span class="question10">deviate</span></span> from the <span class="highlight">primary</span> group's norms. For <span class="highlight">instance</span>, some social groups <span class="highlight">employ</span> shunning (a person can <span class="highlight">remain</span> in the <span class="highlight">community</span>, but others are forbidden to <span class="highlight">interact</span> with the person) as a <span class="highlight">device</span> to bring into <span class="highlight">line</span> individuals whose <span class="highlight">behavior</span> goes beyond that allowed by the <span class="highlight">particular</span> group. <span class="highlight">Even</span> more important, <span class="highlight">primary</span> groups <span class="highlight">define</span> social reality for us by structuring our experiences. By providing us with definitions of situations, they <span class="highlight">elicit</span> from our <span class="highlight">behavior</span> that conforms to group-devised meanings. <span class="highlight">Primary</span> groups, then, serve both as carriers of social norms and as enforcers of them.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">complex</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. delicate</p><p>B. elaborate</p><p>C. private</p><p>D. common</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B complex: complicated. A is subtle and exquisite; B is complicated and elaborate; C is private and private; D is ordinary. So B's elaborate is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true of a relationship?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is a structure of associations with many people.</p><p>B. It should be studied in the course of a social interaction.</p><p>C. It places great demands on people.</p><p>D. It develops gradually overtime.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Position the keyword to the last sentence with the relationship. Note that the relationships can't be used as key words because of repeated occurrences. The original sentence states that when this association lasts long enough that a stable expectation has been formed between the two individuals, it is called relationship, so D says that development is correct over time. A's many people, B's study, C's demand did not say</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question3">endowing</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. leaving</p><p>B. exposing</p><p>C. providing</p><p>D. understanding</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>Endow give, donate, so provide provide, supply correct. The original sentence says that sometimes we cooperate with others just to finish something, but there is no significant, guess the word should be some meaning, only provide and leave that there is, but leave is the rest, so wrong. As far as the B exposure D is understood, it is completely wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred about instrumental ties from the author's mention of working with competitors in paragraph 2?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Instrumental ties can develop even in situations in which people would normally not cooperate.</p><p>B. Instrumental ties require as much emotional investment as expressive ties.</p><p>C. Instrumental ties involve security, love, and acceptance.</p><p>D. Instrumental ties should be expected to be significant.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Using the keyword of competitor to locate the penultimate sentence, saying that occasionally this means working with competitors rather than competition, and this this means that this sentence is related to the previous sentence. The first sentence says that instrumental ties are formed when we cooperate with others to achieve a certain purpose, which is exactly the same as that of A who said that there are usually uncooperative people. B didn't say that C was opposed to the third sentence of the original text. D opposed the last sentence of the original text.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, what do sociologists see as the main difference between primary and secondary groups?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Primary groups consist of people working together, while secondary groups exist outside of work settings.</p><p>B. In primary groups people are seen as means, while in secondary groups people are seen as ends.</p><p>C. Primary groups involve personal relationships, while secondary groups are mainly practical in purpose.</p><p>D. Primary groups are generally small, while secondary groups often contain more than two people.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The primary group and the secondary group are used as keywords to locate the second sentence and the fourth sentence. Two groups are said respectively. The primary is more intimate, and the secondary is formed because of some common purpose in advance. So the answer is C. A mistake, not work to distinguish between the two groups; the same is not the same as the number of people, so D wrong; C's end does not end is the original to say, can not distinguish between the two groups.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from the author's claim in paragraph 3 that primary group relationships sometimes evolve out of secondary group relationships?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Secondary group relationships begin by being primary group relationships.</p><p>B. A secondary group relationship that is highly visible quickly becomes a primary group relationship.</p><p>C. Sociologists believe that only primary group relationships are important to society.</p><p>D. Even in secondary groups, frequent communication serves to bring people into close relationships.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The keyword is positioned with the word evolve out of to the penultimate sentence, but this sentence is almost exactly the same as the question, so it is not the answer. Looking back, this indicates that there is a link between the upper and lower sentences. The following sentence says that this kind of evolve happened in the context of work, and then said that colleagues can become very close friends by sharing various things, that is, an example of secondary change primary, so the correct answer is D. A said anti; neither B and C spoke, and C had common sense.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The phrase "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">size up</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. enlarge</p><p>B. evaluate</p><p>C. impress</p><p>D. accept</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B <span class="question7">size up</span>: Estimated, estimated. A is an enlargement; B is an estimate, an assessment; C is an impression, transmission; D is an acceptance. So the correct answer is B's evaluate.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Sociologists think that cultural patterns establish connections between the individual and the larger society.</p><p>B. Sociologists believe that individuals with a sense of oneness bridge the gap between society and primary groups.</p><p>C. Sociologists think primary groups contribute to social solidarity because they help maintain a society's cultural patterns.</p><p>D. Sociologists believe that the cultural patterns that provide social solidarity arise as bridges from primary groups.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C The structure of the original text is that the sociologist regards the primary group as blabla because blabla. The main logic is causality. Only C expresses the correct causality. A is missing part of the original text, wrong; B's information is completely deranged and wrong; D's cause and result are completely mismatched, so it is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>This passage is developed primarily by</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. drawing comparisons between theory and practice</p><p>B. presenting two opposing theories</p><p>C. defining important concepts and providing examples of them</p><p>D. discussing causes and their effects</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Asked about the organizational structure of this article, the questions of the full text should focus on the beginning of each paragraph. The original text first proposed two relations, then said an expressive tie and an instrumental tie, and finally said the conditions of the primary group. The opposing opposition relationship mentioned by B is obviously wrong. The original text is only to compare the relationship between the two, and the former may be produced by the latter; A's theory and practice are totally silent on the original, and it is also said that the comparison is not right; the cause and effect of D is The original did not say anything. The author defines two groups and two ties, so C said that the definition concept is correct, and the author has an explanation after defining the concept, so C is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">deviate</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. detract</p><p>B. advance</p><p>C. select</p><p>D. depart</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question10">deviate</span>: Deviation, derailment. A is devalued, subtracted, transferred; B is developing, moving forward; C is picking; D is leaving, moving away. So the correct answer is D's depart deviation.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 7, why would a social group use shunning?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To enforce practice of the kinds of behavior acceptable to the group</p><p>B. To discourage offending individuals from remaining in the group</p><p>C. To commend and reward the behavior of the other members of the group</p><p>D. To decide which behavioral norms should be passed on to the next generation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Targeting to the fourth sentence with shunning keywords, saying that people will use shunning to get back from the deviant, but did not give reasons. The example for example in this sentence is an example of the previous sentence. The preceding sentence says that if the reward is not enough, we will exclude those who are not following the rules, so everything is for strengthening the rules. The answer is A. B said that the people in the group were not encouraged to offend. The original did not say offenders; neither did C's reward nor D's next generation say anything.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>People who do not live alone, for example, tend to make healthier life choices and develop fewer pathologies than people who live by themselves..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, two transition points, are the conjunctions for example and the noun healthier life choices, according to example exclude C and D, because the original also has for example, while the two for example are not used continuously when speaking normally; and according to healthier The life choices and the sense of well-being substitution in the original text can also be determined to be A or B, but after the A point, the them is closely related to the preceding text, so the answer is B.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="table"><div class="question"><p>Complete the table below by selecting three answer choices that are characteristics of primary groups and two answer choices that are characteristics of secondary groups.

The main part is in the second and third paragraphs, but the description of these two paragraphs is also primary after primary, so the order is still there. The fourth and fifth sentences of the third paragraph correspond to the two answers of existinging and viewing, respectively, so the two answers belong to secondary; the second and third sentences of the third sentence correspond to provided answers, and the third and the second sentence correspond to involving answers. The third and fourth sentences of the last paragraph correspond to the developing option, which is easily selected by combining the answers to the 11 questions.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
