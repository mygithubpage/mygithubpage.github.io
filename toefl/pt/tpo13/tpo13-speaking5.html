My mom said I could borrow her van, you know, so everyone would fit, but unfortunately, it broke down, and it's not gonna be repaired in time for the trip.</p><p>(woman) Oh! So what're you going to do? Can you rent a van?</p><p>(man) Yeah, that's a possibility. A little risky for me, though. I've tried to get in touch with the club members but only four have gotten back to me and said they could contribute some money for the cause.</p><p>(woman) What about the other members?</p><p>(man) I don't know! It'd probably be OK with them, but that's the risk. I don't know for sure. I don't what to get stuck with having to pay for most of the bill.</p><p>(woman) Well, since not everyone has gotten back to you, what don 't you just postpone the trip, you know, until your mom's van's been repaired?</p><p>(man) Yeah, I could do that, though I'm sure everyone would be disappointed when they show up tomorrow read y to go and found out that we're not going.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discuss two possible solutions to the man's problem. Briefly summarize the problem then state which solution you recommend and explain why. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>This question asks you to briefly summarize the problem being discussed (that the man, who is the president of the Anthropology Club, needs to transport the club members to the museum tomorrow, but the van he was planning on using has broken down) and recommend one of the solutions. Please note that it is not a requirement to summarize both solutions (renting a van or postponing the trip). After you state which solution you recommend, you should offer reasons and support for your opinion. For example, if you agree with the first solution, you could say that the club members will almost certainly help him pay for the van rental since they are his friends. You could add that the special exhibit might end before they could get to the museum at a later date, so if he postpones the trip, the club members could end up very disappointed.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Actually, the man's problem is that her mom's van is down, so he couldn't take his club members to see the exhibit tomorrow. The woman offers two suggestions for the man: he could rent a van for that trip or he could postpone the trip till his mom's car gets fixed up. Well, I think the man could rent a van. First, nobody would blame him, for not using his mom's car, which indeed is a quite understandable emergency, since no one would share a trip on a van that needs repairing. Secondly, I am sure his friends, the club members would be glad to share the rent and the gas fee when they get together. After all, their purpose is to enjoy the special exhibit not to take advantage of the man's free ride. So I think the man should rent a car.

Although she doesn't need to describe both solutions, she still mentions both, and goes into detail on the solution she is recommending. She offers a lot of support for her opinion—that he shouldn't disappoint the club members, and that as club president it is his responsibility to borrow and pay for the transportation. Her pronunciation is almost always clear, with the exception of the word "exhibition." She also has some grammatical inaccuracies, such as saying "Man is the president" instead of "The man is the president," but they are minor and do not prevent the listener from understanding her points. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 166.</b></p><p><audio src="track_166.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker's response is filled with many hesitations, which prevent her from completely finishing. She covers the problem accurately but runs out of time before she can finish explaining why she thinks the man should postpone the exhibit. In this case, she should not have tried to mention both solutions, because she used up needed time by doing so, and she is not quite fluent enough to cover that much information during the response time. Her grammar is generally accurate and her pronunciation of individual words is clear, but her frequent hesitations make her response somewhat difficult to follow.</p></div></main></body></html>
