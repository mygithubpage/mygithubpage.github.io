It's got peaks and valleys, vegetation, rocky areas, and some sea animals have developed permanent colors or shapes to resemble these environmental features. This camouflage helps to disguise them from predators by enabling them to blend into, uh, a specific part of the sea. For instance, take a kind of fish like the Leafy Sea Dragon, well, the name says it all, it resembles a small green dragon with leaf-like protrusions sticking out like arms. Now because its colors and shapes, it blends in extremely well with green sea plants. So when the Leafy Sea Dragon is swimming through these plants, predators have trouble seeing it. But when it enters other environments without these green plants, its camouflage doesn't work anymore.Now other sea animals are difficult to spot anywhere in the sea because their type of camouflage enables them to change color. Take the Cuttlefish, a fish that is closely related to the squid and octopus, unlike Leafy Sea Dragons, Cuttlefish have not developed any particular shape to hide from predators. But, uh, they have a lot more mobility because their camouflage allows them to blend in to any environment, because Cuttlefish have shifting pigments that allow them to change color in a matter of seconds, and, so they can almost instantaneously match their color of their surroundings. If they're swimming by green sea plants, they'll turn green. And if they're swimming over the brown sea floor, they'll turn brown. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the examples of Leafy Sea Dragon and the Cuttlefish, describe two kinds of camouflage and the benefits they provide. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>When answering this question, you should provide a summary of the lecture in order to describe the two different kinds of camouflage the professor talks about and how the types of camouflage protect the animals that use them. You should explain that some sea animals have permanent camouflage (like their colors and shapes) that blend in with their specific environment, and describe the example of the leafy sea dragon, which is green and looks like the leaves it is surrounded by. You should also explain that other animals have camouflage that changes colors to match whatever environment the animals are in, so that they can move around and still be protected. For example, the cuttlefish can turn brown when it is swimming over the sea floor, and green when it is swimming near plants. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Some sea animals, in order to survive from predators, develop some kinds of camouflage to blend in with their environment. One of them is a kind of fish called leafy sea dragon. It looks like a green dragon with small leaf-like protrusions sticking out from its body like arms. Its color and shape help it to perfectly match with its environment. When it's swimming among the green sea plants; it looks just like the sea plants, so its predators are not able to detect it. But the camouflage will lose its efficacy if the fish enters a different surrounding without the plants. So there's another kind of camouflage that is able to change as circumstances change. For example, the cuttlefish has shifting pigment that allows immediate color change if need be, so it can always go with its surroundings to avoid being recognized and eaten by predators wherever it is.

He describes the two types of camouflage, the examples of the sea creatures that use the types of camouflage and how the camouflage benefits them, as well as how the types of camouflage differ from each other. He makes use of complex structures, such as "the cuttlefish is different from the sea dragon in that it doesn't have . .." and makes only minor errors. His pronunciation and delivery in general are very clear. His intonation is somewhat flat, which may cause some listener effort. Even though this is a high-level response, the speaker could benefit from increased attention to stress at the sentence level and using intonation more for emphasis. Overall, the response is complete and highly intelligible. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 168.</b></p><p><audio src="track_168.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker provides a mostly complete response. It contains a description of what camouflage is and why it is useful, as well as explanations of the two sea creatures and how they use camouflage. The speaker could have provided a stronger response, however, if he had provided more information about the differences between the two types of camouflage (he mentioned that cuttlefish can change their color and shape, but didn't contrast this with the sea dragon's permanent camouflage). His hesitation between words and within words is at times distracting, but overall his message is clear. The speaker would likely benefit from working on agreement and more advanced vocabulary (to avoid confusing phrases such as "two dOcerent method," "the cuttlefish is another examples," and "they shape any type any colors").</p></div></main></body></html>
