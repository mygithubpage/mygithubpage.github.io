          <h4 class="w3-center">New Stadium</h4>
          <p>A university official announced plans to spend $2 million to build a new stadium, commenting that a new stadium would help the university achieve its goal of attracting more top students. The official also said that, additionally, building a new stadium would allow the university to strengthen its relationship with the town since a new and larger stadium would have the space to seat not only students, parents, and alumni, but members of the local community as well.</p>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to two students discussing the article.</p>
          <p>(man) So what do you think of the university's new plan?</p>
          <p>(woman) Oh, I don't know. I don't think it's gonna work.</p>
          <p>(man) No?</p>
          <p>(woman) I mean, I can't imagine top students being too thrilled about some of the conditions on this campus.</p>
          <p>(man) What do you mean?</p>
          <p>(woman) Like, the science laboratory having such old outdated equipment and the library needing more books, and the student center being so small. I think that the 2 million could be spent in better places if the university is really serious about achieving its goal.</p>
          <p>(man) OK. But what about the other reason for building the stadium? I mean right now we have so little contact with the town.</p>
          <p>(woman) Yeah, but this won't help relations. Look, people from town hardly ever come to the games because our teams always lose. And they're not suddenly going to improve over night. Besides, adding seats won't make a difference. I mean, if people from town didn't come before, they won't come now just because the place is bigger.</p>

        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>The woman expresses her opinion about the university's plan. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion. </p>

          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>In this question, you should use the reading and listening passages to describe the university's plan (to spend money to build a new stadium), state the woman's opinion about the plan, and explain the reasons why the woman disagrees with the plan. The woman disagrees with the idea that a new stadium will attract top students because she thinks that other facilities in the university are in poor condition—including the science labs, the library, and the student center—and that money should be spent on them before a new stadium. She also disagrees that a new stadium would attract people from the local community because she thinks people don't come because the teams always lose and a larger stadium wouldn't change that. </p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>The speaker gives a full response. He organizes the response well, devoting equal time to the woman's two reasons and covering most of the material in the important points above. Note that providing every detail of the plan or the woman's reasons is not a requirement for full credit; when discussing the poor facilities, for example, the man simply says "like the library, and other places." His vocabulary and language use is precise and appropriate throughout for the most part, though there are a few minor errors that do not interfere with comprehension. Pronunciation is good overall, but there is some evident hesitation throughout. The response could be more fluid, but it is not choppy to the point that it creates listener effort.</p>

          <p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 162.</b></p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>The speaker does address all of the main points, but they are not developed fully. For one, he does not clearly state at the beginning what the plan is (to build a new stadium); this is important for the listener to understand the response fully. He also leaves out other important information, such as the condition of the other facilities he mentions, which is again important in order to understand the woman's opinion. He does include a transition ("second, she says. .") before discussing her second reason, which helps organization. Though the response is understandable, the language is often imprecise and demonstrates a limited range of vocabulary and grammatical structures (for example, "Only new stadium cannot invite top students"). The speech is generally intelligible, but pronunciation problems, mainly with individual sounds, and hesitations when searching for language do create some listener effort. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Well, the woman disagrees with the plan for two main reasons. In the first place, she believes that such amount of money could be wisely spent in some other places in order to attract more top students. For example, she says, the university could use the funds to update the outdated equipment in the lab, get more books for the library and try to enlarge the students' center, which she thinks will virtually attract more top students. Secondly, she also holds the point that people from the town don't come to the game of the university just because the teams of the university always lose, not because of the places of the game, which means just building a stadium would not do much help, since people won't change their impressions overnight. So based on the reasons stated above the woman disagrees with the plan of the university. (147 words)</p>
