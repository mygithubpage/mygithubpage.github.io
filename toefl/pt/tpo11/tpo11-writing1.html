This is troubling because the trend has unfortunate effects for the reading public, for culture in general, and for the future of literature itself. While there has been a decline in book reading generally, the decline has been especially sharp for literature. This is unfortunate because nothing else provides the intellectual stimulation that literature does. Literature encourages us to exercise our imaginations, empathize with others, and expand our understanding of language. So by reading less literature, the reading public is missing out on important benefits. Unfortunately, missing out on the benefits of literature is not the only problem. What are people reading instead? Consider the prevalence of self-help books on lists of best sellers. These are usually superficial poorly written, and intellectually undemanding. Additionally, instead of sitting down with a challenging novel, many persons are now more likely to turn on the television, watch a music video, or read a Web page. Clearly, diverting time previously spent in reading literature to trivial forms of entertainment has lowered the level of culture in general. The trend of reading less literature is all the more regrettable because it is taking place during a period when good literature is being written. There are many talented writers today, but theylack an audience. This fact is bound to lead publishers to invest less in literature and so support fewer serious writers. Thus, the writing as well as the reading of literature is likely to decline because of the poor standards of today's readers. </p></article><div><audio src="tpo11-writing1.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>ProfessorIt is often said that people are reading less literature today than they used to. What should of this?Well first, a book doesn't have to be literature to be intellectually stimulating. Science writing history, political analysis and so forth aren't literature perhaps, but they are often of high quality and these kinds of books can be just as creative and well-written as a novel or a play. They can stimulate the imagination. So don't assume that someone who isn't reading literature isn't reading a good book.But let's say that people aren't just spending less time with literature, they are also spending less time with books in general. Does that mean that the cultures is in decline? No, there's plenty of culturally valuable material that isn't written-music and movies, for example. Are people wasting their time when they listen to a brilliant song or watch a good movie? Do these non-literary activities lower cultural standards? Of course not. Culture has changed. In today's culture, there are many forms of expression available other than novels and poems. And some of these creative forms speak more directly to contemporary concerns than literature does.Finally, it's probably true that there's less support for literature today than in earlier generations. But don't be too quick to blame the readers. Sometimes it's the author's faults. Let's be honest. A lot of modern literature is intended to be difficult to understand. Here is not much reason to suppose that earlier generations of readers would have read a lot of today's literature either. </p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they cast doubt on specific points made reading passage.</p></section><section><h5>Point Made in the Reading Passage</h5><p>The passage argues that reading less literature means that readers are missing out on ways to stimulate their imagination and help with their mental development.</p><p>The passage argues that many of the kinds of  reading that people currently spend time on instead of literature are just trivial entertainment and lead to lower cultural standards.</p><p>The passage says that another bad effect of the  decline in reading literature is that talented writers of literature are not being supported.</p><h5>Contrasting Point from the Lecture</h5><p>The lecturer points out that there are other forms of writing that are of high quality and as intellectually stimulating as literature.</p><p>The lecturer argues that people spend time on culturally valuable activities such as listening to good music or watching good movies. The definition of culture is changing.</p><p>The lecturer argues that maybe there is less  readership of literature because the writers of literature nowadays are making their books/ works too hard to understand.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The lecturer raises several arguments to counter the reading passage's strong criticism of the public's declining interest in reading literature.</p><p>The lecturer argues that literature is only one among many forms of reading genres from which the public can benefit intellectually. The public also benefits from reading works of science fiction and historical novels, among other reading genres. Therefore, the reading is wrong to claim that the public is suffering great losses by not reading literature.</p><p>Furthermore, the lecturer explains that even if it is true that the public is reading fewer books and watching more television and films instead, it does not necessarily mean that culture is in decline.Television and film are simply modern forms of cultural expression that are also intellectually stimulating and directly relevant to contemporary life.</p><p>Finally, the lecturer admits a decline in audience and support of literature in today's society, but she attributes it to the authors themselves, who have alienated themselves from the reading public by using overly complex language. The reading, however, blames the lowering standards of the public for the declining interest in reading great works of literature.</p></article></div><article><h5>Sample Response</h5><p>The lecturer discusses the points made in the text but reaches a different conclusion in each case. For one thing, she states that yes, people are reading less literature then they were in earlier times but this does not equal an imediate decline of culture. On the contrary, in her opinion our culture is simply evolving and changing. Although literature is one of the most obvious elements of culture, there are also lots of other forms of artistic expression in our everchanging culture, e.g. music. And those elements are not less valuable and less creative then literature and they appeal to more modern concerns than literature. </p><p>Also the lecturer disputes the text that says we are going to lose interesting writers of literature. She says that today literature is not interesting enough for the reader! In the lecturers opinion this is mainly due to the fact that modern literature is often written with the intention of beeing difficult to understand, which does not make it very attractive for the modern reader. </p><p>And finally just because people are not reading literature anymore this does not mean they are not reading at all and losing their imagination and empathy; instead there are many other valuable types of books which people are reading, e.g. science textbooks and political analyzis. These books can stimulate readers and provide satisfaction and learning.</p>&gt;
  
          <h5>Rater Comments</h5><p>This response earns a score of 5. The response clearly conveys the key ideas contained in the three points from the lecture. Notice that the points are not presented in the order they are discussed in the reading and lecture, but the way that this writer has presented them is coherent and accurate. Grammatical errors such as "then" instead of "than" in the first paragraph and a missing possessive apostrophe with "lecturers" in the second paragraph are few and minor. Grammatical variety and complexity are clearly present.</p></article></main></body></html>
