            <span class="time" data-times="6.22" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an <span class="highlight">Architecture</span> Class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="15.46" data-time="6.22">[00:06.22]</span>Professor: Today, we are taking a little <span class="highlight">detour</span> from the grand styles of public <span class="highlight">architecture</span> we've been studying to look at <span class="highlight">residential</span> <span class="highlight">architecture</span> in the United States. <span class="time" data-times="13.32" data-time="21.68">[00:21.68]</span>Since this is something we can all <span class="highlight">identify</span> with, I think it will help us see the relationship between the <span class="highlight">function</span> of a structure and its style or form.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.09" data-time="35">[00:35.00]</span>This has been an <span class="highlight">ongoing</span> theme in our discussions, and we will be getting back to it in just a moment. <span class="time" data-times="13.9" data-time="41.09">[00:41.09]</span>But before we get started, I want you to take a moment to think: does anyone know what the single most <span class="highlight">popular</span> style for a house in the United States is today? Bob?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.73" data-time="54.99">[00:54.99]</span>Student 1: I <span class="highlight">bet</span> it is the ranch-style house.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.07" data-time="57.72">[00:57.72]</span>Professor: Well, in this area, probably. <span class="time" data-times="4.05" data-time="60.79">[01:00.79]</span>But are we <span class="highlight">typical</span>? Yes, Sue.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.18" data-time="64.84">[01:04.84]</span>Student 2: How about the kind of house my grandparents live in? <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="68.02">[01:08.02]</span>They call it a <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.31" data-time="71.31">[01:11.31]</span>Professor: That's the one. <span class="time" data-times="6.27" data-time="72.62">[01:12.62]</span>Here is a drawing of what we <span class="highlight">consider</span> of a <span class="highlight">classic</span> <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod house. <span class="time" data-times="8.62" data-time="78.89">[01:18.89]</span>These days, you see this style all over the United States. <span class="time" data-times="7.89" data-time="87.51">[01:27.51]</span>But it first showed up in U.S. northeast, in the New England <span class="highlight">region</span>, around the late 1600s. <span class="time" data-times="22.99" data-time="95.4">[01:35.40]</span>For those of you who don't know the northeast costal <span class="highlight">region</span>, <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod is a <span class="highlight">peninsula</span>, a narrow <span class="highlight">strip</span> of land that juts out into the Atlantic, and so many houses in this <span class="highlight">particular</span> style were built on <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod, that the name of the place became the name of the style.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="118.39">[01:58.39]</span>Now why did the <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod style house become so <span class="highlight">popular</span> in the northeast? <span class="time" data-times="6.96" data-time="125.38">[02:05.38]</span>Well, one <span class="highlight">reason</span> is that it's a great example of form following <span class="highlight">function</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.76" data-time="132.34">[02:12.34]</span>We've talked about this design <span class="highlight">principle</span> a lot about form following <span class="highlight">function</span>. <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="139.1">[02:19.10]</span>And what did we say it's meant? <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="141.4">[02:21.40]</span>Someone give me an <span class="highlight">application</span> of this <span class="highlight">principle</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="144.59">[02:24.59]</span>What is this <span class="highlight">concept</span> that form should follow <span class="highlight">function</span>? <span class="time" data-times="4.79" data-time="148.66">[02:28.66]</span>How would it be applied to housing design?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="21.96" data-time="153.45">[02:33.45]</span>Student 2: Well, if it means that the design of a building should be based on the needs of the people who use it, then, well, the <span class="highlight">architect</span> has to be very <span class="highlight">practical</span> to think about the people who actually be living in the house or working in the office building, whatever. <span class="time" data-times="6.9" data-time="175.41">[02:55.41]</span>So for the <span class="highlight">architect</span>, it's all about the users not about showing off how <span class="highlight">creative</span> you can be.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="182.31">[03:02.31]</span>Professor: Good, of <span class="highlight">course</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.27" data-time="184.71">[03:04.71]</span>For a <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod house, it might be <span class="highlight">even</span> more <span class="highlight">accurate</span> to say that form also follows <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.98" data-time="193.98">[03:13.98]</span>Who knows what the <span class="highlight">climate</span>'s like on <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="200.96">[03:20.96]</span>Student 1: Cold in the winter...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.18" data-time="203.05">[03:23.05]</span>Student 2: And whenever I visit my grandparents, it's really wet. <span class="time" data-times="6.01" data-time="207.23">[03:27.23]</span>It's usually either raining or snowing or foggy and windy, too. <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="213.24">[03:33.24]</span>I guess because it's so <span class="highlight">exposed</span> to the ocean?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="0.94" data-time="216.63">[03:36.63]</span>Professor: That's right. <span class="time" data-times="10.38" data-time="217.57">[03:37.57]</span>So take another look at this drawing, and you can <span class="highlight">image</span> how this design might be particularly helpful in that kind of <span class="highlight">climate</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.81" data-time="227.95">[03:47.95]</span>Notice how the house is <span class="highlight">fairly</span> low to the ground. <span class="time" data-times="7.94" data-time="235.76">[03:55.76]</span>This <span class="highlight">relatively</span> low <span class="highlight">compact</span> structure helps the house <span class="highlight">withstand</span> the strong winds blowing off the ocean.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.2" data-time="243.7">[04:03.70]</span>And look at the <span class="highlight">slope</span> of the roof, the <span class="highlight">steep</span> <span class="highlight">angle</span> helps keep off all that rain and snow that accumulates in the winter. <span class="time" data-times="8.67" data-time="251.9">[04:11.90]</span>Another thing, <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod houses usually face south to take <span class="highlight">advantage</span> of the sun's warmth <span class="highlight">through</span> the windows. <span class="time" data-times="2.21" data-time="260.57">[04:20.57]</span>That's helpful in winter. <span class="time" data-times="5.29" data-time="262.78">[04:22.78]</span>Now what can you tell me about the chimney, about its location.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="268.07">[04:28.07]</span>Student 2: Well, it's in the middle. <span class="time" data-times="4.39" data-time="270.42">[04:30.42]</span>Because...does that have something to do with heating the houses? <span class="time" data-times="3.55" data-time="274.81">[04:34.81]</span>I mean since the heat never has to travel very far.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.14" data-time="278.36">[04:38.36]</span>Student 1: That means you can heat the house more efficiently, right?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.87" data-time="281.5">[04:41.50]</span>Professor: Exactly, now see how the house has very little <span class="highlight">exterior</span> decoration, that's also <span class="highlight">typical</span> of early <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod houses. <span class="time" data-times="17.24" data-time="291.37">[04:51.37]</span>The wind was one <span class="highlight">reason</span>, nothing sticking out might blow away in the <span class="highlight">harsh</span> weather, but there was probably another <span class="highlight">reason</span>, not related to the <span class="highlight">climate</span>, more <span class="highlight">reflection</span> of a <span class="highlight">rural</span> New England society back then. <span class="time" data-times="7.63" data-time="308.61">[05:08.61]</span>You see <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod houses were not built in the big cities, where all the rich people lived back then. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="316.24">[05:16.24]</span>These were <span class="highlight">modest</span> dwellings.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.12" data-time="318.9">[05:18.90]</span>The people who built them <span class="highlight">simply</span> couldn't <span class="highlight">afford</span> lots of expensive <span class="highlight">decorative</span> details. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="325.02">[05:25.02]</span>But that was more than just a matter of money. <span class="time" data-times="5.1" data-time="329.09">[05:29.09]</span>In these <span class="highlight">rural</span> areas, people depended on each other for <span class="highlight">survival</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.76" data-time="334.19">[05:34.19]</span>Neighbors had to help and support each other in a difficult environment, so you didn't want to <span class="highlight">appear</span> to be showing off.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="8.78" data-time="343.95">[05:43.95]</span>You'd want to <span class="highlight">avoid</span> anything that might set you apart from your neighbors, the same people you might need to help you someday. <span class="time" data-times="16.52" data-time="352.73">[05:52.73]</span>So all these help to create an attitude of conformity in the <span class="highlight">community</span>, and you can see why a <span class="highlight">modest</span>, a very <span class="highlight">plain</span> style would become so widely imitated <span class="highlight">throughout</span> <span class="highlight">rural</span> New England.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.99" data-time="369.25">[06:09.25]</span>Student 2: It is <span class="highlight">plain</span>, but you know it's nice looking.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="376.24">[06:16.24]</span>Professor: Good point, and in fact it's precisely that as <span class="highlight">aesthetic</span> <span class="highlight">appeal</span>, the...the <span class="highlight">purity</span>, the nearly <span class="highlight">perfect</span> proportions of the house...that's another <span class="highlight">reason</span> for the <span class="highlight">Cape</span> Cod's <span class="highlight">enduring</span> popularity <span class="highlight">even</span> in places where the <span class="highlight">climate</span>'s so <span class="highlight">mild</span>, that it's <span class="highlight">functional</span> design doesn't matter. </p>
