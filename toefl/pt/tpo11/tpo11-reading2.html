To North Americans, the robins <span class="highlight">simply</span><span class="highlight">vacation</span> in the south each winter. Furthermore, they fly to very <span class="highlight">specific</span> places in South America and will often come back to the same trees in North American yards the following <span class="highlight">spring</span>. The question is not why they would leave the cold of winter so much as how they find their way around. The question <span class="question2">perplexed</span> people for years, until, in the 1950s, a German scientist named Gustave Kramer provided some answers and, in the <span class="highlight">process</span>, raised new questions.</p><p>Kramer initiated important new kinds of research regarding how animals orient and <span class="highlight">navigate</span>. <span class="highlight">Orientation</span> is <span class="highlight">simply</span> facing in the right direction; <span class="highlight">navigation</span> involves finding ones way from point A to point B.</p><p>Early in his research, Kramer found that caged <span class="highlight">migratory</span> birds became very restless at about the time they would <span class="highlight">normally</span> have begun <span class="highlight">migration</span> in the wild. Furthermore, he noticed that as they fluttered around in the cage, they often launched themselves in the direction of their normal <span class="highlight">migratory</span><span class="highlight">route</span>. <span class="question3">He then set up experiments with caged starlings and found that their <span class="highlight">orientation</span> was, in fact, in the <span class="highlight">proper</span><span class="highlight">migratory</span> direction except when the sky was overcast, at which times there was no <span class="highlight">clear</span> direction to their restless movements.</span> Kramer surmised, <span class="highlight">therefore</span>, that they were orienting according to the <span class="highlight">position</span> of the Sun. To test this idea, he blocked their view of the Sun and used mirrors to change its <span class="highlight">apparent</span><span class="highlight">position</span>. He found that under these circumstances, the birds oriented with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the new "Sun." They seemed to be using the Sun as a <span class="highlight">compass</span> to <span class="highlight">determine</span> direction. At the time, this idea seemed <span class="question4">preposterous</span>. How could a bird <span class="highlight">navigate</span> by the Sun when some of us lose our way with road maps? <span class="highlight">Obviously</span>, more testing was in order.</p><p>So, in another set of experiments, Kramer put <span class="highlight">identical</span> food boxes around the cage, with food in only one of the boxes. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The boxes were <span class="highlight">stationary</span>, and the one containing food was always at the same point of the <span class="highlight">compass</span>. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>However, its <span class="highlight">position</span> with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to the surroundings could be changed by revolving either the <span class="highlight">inner</span> cage containing the birds or the outer walls, which served as the background.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>As long as the birds could see the Sun, no matter how their surroundings were altered, they went directly to the correct food box. 
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>whether the box appeared in front of the right wall or the left wall, they showed no signs of <span class="highlight">confusion</span>. On overcast days, however,
the birds were <span class="highlight">disoriented</span> and had trouble locating their food box.</p><p>In experimenting with <span class="highlight">artificial</span> suns, Kramer made another interesting discovery. If the <span class="highlight">artificial</span> Sun remained <span class="highlight">stationary</span>, the birds would <span class="highlight">shift</span> their direction with <span class="highlight">respect</span> to it at a <span class="highlight">rate</span> of about 15 degrees per hour, the Sun's <span class="highlight">rate</span> of movement <span class="highlight">across</span> the sky. Apparently, the birds were assuming that the "Sun" they saw was moving at that <span class="highlight">rate</span>. When the real Sun was <span class="highlight">visible</span>, however, the birds maintained a <span class="highlight">constant</span> direction as it moved <span class="highlight">across</span> the sky. In other words, they were able to <span class="highlight">compensate</span> for the Sun's movement. This meant that some <span class="highlight">sort</span> of biological clock was operating-and a very <span class="highlight">precise</span> clock at that.</p><p>What about birds that <span class="highlight">migrate</span> at night? Perhaps they <span class="highlight">navigate</span> by the night sky. To test the idea, caged night-migrating birds were placed on the floor of a planetarium during their <span class="highlight">migratory</span> period. A planetarium is <span class="highlight">essentially</span> a theater with a domelike ceiling onto which a night sky can be projected for any night of the year. When the planetarium sky matched the sky outside, the birds fluttered in the direction of their normal <span class="highlight">migration</span>. But when the <span class="highlight">dome</span> was rotated, the birds changed their direction to <span class="highlight">match</span> the <span class="highlight">artificial</span> sky. The results clearly indicated that the birds were orienting according to the stars.</p><p>There is <span class="question12">accumulating</span><span class="highlight">evidence</span> indicating that birds <span class="highlight">navigate</span> by using a wide <span class="highlight">variety</span> of <span class="highlight">environmental</span> cues. Other areas under <span class="highlight">investigation</span> include magnetism, landmarks, coastlines, sonar, and <span class="highlight">even</span> smells. The studies are <span class="highlight">complicated</span> by the fact that the <span class="highlight">data</span> are sometimes <span class="highlight">contradictory</span> and the mechanisms apparently change from time to time. Furthermore, one <span class="highlight">sensory</span><span class="highlight">ability</span> may back up another.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred about bird migration from paragraph 1?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Birds will take the most direct migratory route to their new habitat.</p><p>B. The purpose of migration is to join with larger groups of birds.</p><p>C. Bird migration generally involves moving back and forth between north and south.</p><p>D. The destination of birds' migration can change from year to year.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. The keyword of this question is obviously not very easy to find, and the answer is too long, so look at the beginning of this paragraph and say that South American birds fly to the north in spring and North American birds fly to the south in winter. So the answer is C, between north and south, other options have no relevant information.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">perplexed</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. defeated</p><p>B. interested</p><p>C. puzzled</p><p>D. occupied</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C perplex: Confused. A is a few hundred; B is interested in... C is confusing; Dshi occupies. So C's puzzle is correct. Corresponding to the original The question <span class="question2">perplexed</span> people for years, until, in the 1950s, a German scientist named Gustave Kramer provided some answers and, in the process, raised new questions. The original sentence said that this problem perflex people for many years and did not give until the fifties Some answers, that is, no answer before, so the answer is troubled. Now that the answer has been found, A's defeat must be wrong; just B is sure not to be interested. If there is no problem, then there is no need to say that the answer is given. The Occupy of D is Occupy, but it is not enough to make people have problems, so D is also wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Experiments revealed that caged starlings displayed a lack of directional sense and restless movements.</p><p>B. Experiments revealed that caged starlings were unable to orient themselves in the direction of their normal migratory route.</p><p>C. Experiments revealed that the restless movement of caged starlings had no clear direction.</p><p>D. Experiments revealed that caged starlings' orientation was accurate unless the weather was overcast.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D, The structure of the original text is that this man did an experiment and got the result. However, the four answers did not say to do experiments, so it is OK to only pay attention to the experimental results. It is correct to say that the orientation of these birds is correct except overcast. ABC is in contradiction with the original sentence. The original sentence emphasizes that there is basically a sense of direction.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question4">preposterous</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. unbelievable</p><p>B. inadequate</p><p>C. limited</p><p>D. creative</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" A"><p>A <span class="question4">preposterous</span>: absurd, ridiculous. A is incredible; B is not enough; C is finite; D is creative. Think of the pre table forward, post table backwards, can come up with this meaning, so unbelievable is unbelievable, incredibly correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, why did Kramer use mirrors to change the apparent position of the Sun?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To test the effect of light on the birds' restlessness</p><p>B. To test whether birds were using the Sun to navigate</p><p>C. To simulate the shifting of light the birds would encounter along their regular migratory route</p><p>D. To cause the birds to migrate at a different time than they would in the wild</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Using the name of the person and the mirror to locate the fourth and fifth sentences, saying that this person thinks that the bird is using the sun to navigate, in order to verify this point of view, this person made an experiment with a mirror, so the purpose of this experiment is to verify the bird. Did you use the sun to navigate? The answer was B. Nothing else was said.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, when do caged starlings become restless?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. When the weather is overcast</p><p>B. When they are unable to identify their normal migratory route</p><p>C. When their normal time for migration arrives</p><p>D. When mirrors are used to change the apparent position of the Sun</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The restless positioning to do the first sentence: Early in his research, Kramer found that caged migratory birds became very restless at about the time they would normally had begins migration in the wild. This sentence clearly stated that they were about to start migrating The time becomes restless and corresponds to the C option. Note that this question is easy to mistakenly choose A. Many students read the restless in the third sentence. However, when the original says overcast, the bird's migratory orientation has no direction, and has nothing to do with restless. B and A in the same sentence, have nothing to do with the problem, so wrong; D in the fourth sentence, also has nothing to do with the problem, do not choose.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 4 about Kramer's reason for filling one food box and leaving the rest empty?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He believed the birds would eat food from only one box.</p><p>B. He wanted to see whether the Sun alone controlled the birds' ability to navigate toward the box with food.</p><p>C. He thought that if all the boxes contained food, this would distract the birds from following their migratory route.</p><p>D. He needed to test whether the birds preferred having the food at any particular point of the compass.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Use the food box as the key word to locate the last sentence of this paragraph. Say that no matter how the box puts the bird, it won't dizzy, but when it's cloudy, it will faint. Combining the previous experiment that K has said, it shows that the bird is using The Sun recognizes the direction, so the answer is B, and this section says another set of experiments so you can look ahead. The previous section also says that birds use the sun to discern directions. So this is just one of a series of experiments. , others did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 5, how did the birds fly when the real Sun was visible?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. They kept the direction of their flight constant.</p><p>B. They changed the direction of their flight at a rate of 15 degrees per hour.</p><p>C. They kept flying toward the Sun.</p><p>D. They flew in the same direction as the birds that were seeing the artificial Sun.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Positioning with the real sun keyword to the penultimate sentence, said that when the real solar energy is seen, the bird's flight direction does not change. A says that the flying direction is constant, completely rewritten, and it is the correct answer. Although C said that the direction of flight was the same, he did not say that the bird was flying toward the sun; B's 15 degrees and D's coincided with the direction of the man-made solar flight.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The experiment described in paragraph 5 caused Kramer to conclude that birds possess a biological clock because</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. when birds navigate they are able to compensate for the changing position of the Sun in the sky</p><p>B. birds innate bearings keep them oriented in a direction that is within 15 degrees of the Sun's direction</p><p>C. birds' migration is triggered by natural environmental cues, such as the position of the Sun</p><p>D. birds shift their direction at a rate of 15 degrees per hour whether the Sun is visible or not</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A. Using the keywords of biological clock to locate the last sentence, but from the outset this means that it means blabla. It used to look ahead and said that these birds keep their flight direction unchanged because they can compensate for the changes caused by changes in the position of the sun. A is the answer. Both B and D say it, but it cannot be the reason for having a biological clock, and C doesn't say anything at all.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, how did the birds navigate in the planetarium's nighttime environment?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. By waiting for the dome to stop rotating</p><p>B. By their position on the planetarium floor</p><p>C. By orienting themselves to the stars in the artificial night sky</p><p>D. By navigating randomly until they found the correct orientation</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C uses the planetarium keyword to locate the third sentence, but this sentence only says a phenomenon. In the past, when the sky of planetarium was the same as outside, the bird migrated normally; when it was not the same, the bird was based on the artificial sky. Positioning, and finally came to be positioned with the stars, so C is the answer, the other did not say at all.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes the author's presentation of information in the passage?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. A number of experiments are described to support the idea that birds use the Sun and the night sky to navigate.</p><p>B. The author uses logic to show that the biological clock in birds is inaccurate.</p><p>C. A structured argument about the importance of internal versus external cues for navigation is presented.</p><p>D. The opposing points of view about bird migration are clarified through the study of contrasting experiments.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A: If you want to read a whole article, you need to look at the first rhetoric question in each paragraph and ask the whole paragraph. So look at the first sentence. The first few paragraphs all say that the birds use the sun for positioning during the day and the bird is based on the night sky. The answer, A, is to describe how the birds are positioned during the day and night.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question12">accumulating</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. new</p><p>B. increasing</p><p>C. convincing</p><p>D. extensive</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B, <span class="question12">accumulating</span>: gradually increased. A is new, B is increasing, C is convincing; D is extensive and numerous. So B's rising is correct. The sentence is a series of cue, so it is more and more, new is wrong, because if it is new or is extensive Will not say other; Similarly, the following sentence says under investigation, so it should be uncertain, convincing wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>He arranged the feed boxes at various positions on a compass..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A Four transition points, the pronoun he, noun feed boxes and noun compass. According to the compass to determine the answer is A or B is correct; pronoun he determines A may be correct; box appears multiple times, do not use; so determine A correct. The sentences to be inserted say put boxes in various places in the compass, and then say what the box looks like.</p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>
