Effective designs create a delicate balance between two things: you need unity and you also need contrast, which is essentially a break in unity. Now, this might seem a little contradictory but let me explain why we need both of these for an effective design.The first principle, we need unity in our design. Think of it as a consistency. Well, an easy and very effective way to do this is by bringing together similar elements, uh, common example is by matching colors. You pick a color and use it for different parts of the room. Say, you pick green and then use a light shade of green for the walls, and maybe a somewhat darker shade for the fabric on the sofa and finally compliment that with a matching green rug. When elements match, the room is unified and gives its resident a sense of order and comfort. OK, but there is such a thing as too much unity. Remember, you need a balance of unity and contrast. If all you do is focus on unity, the result will be a boring room! So what do you do? Well, you apply the second basic principle of design, which is contrast. Contrast serves to disrupt or break up unity in places, but, in a careful and intentional way. Um, well, let's continue using color as an example. To create contrast, color contrast, you need to abruptly change your color scheme once in a while. Uh, let's see, you could throw bright red cushions on your dark green sofa for example. Contrast makes things stand out. The green will look even greener next to the red! So, now your room is more interesting, not completely the same.But watch out! Too much contrast is also dangerous. Just like too much sameness is. Too much contrast will make the room feel busy, chaotic."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Using the points and examples from the lecture, explain what unity and contrast are and how they make interior design more effective. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>In this item, your summary of the key ideas from the lecture should include the definitions of unity and contrast described by the professor. You should also describe how interior designers use unity and contrast, connecting the concepts to the specific examples mentioned. Unity is the repetition of similar elements, which creates a sense of order and comfort. For example, a designer might use similar colors throughout a room. Contrast is an occasional break in unity, which makes the design more interesting. For example, a designer might introduce a strikingly different color in one or two places. Contrast makes the design more interesting; however, too much contrast will make the room feel busy. Effective design creates a balance between unity and contrast. The order in which you present these ideas does not matter, as long as the response is logical and coherent. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>There're two principles for balance in interior design, one is unity, another is contrast. Unity means bringing together same elements into a design. For example, you can use green to decorate your house, grassy green for the wall, darker shady green for the sofa and complement with a matching green in the rug. And this will provide you a sense of order and consistence. However, if you have too much unity in a room, it'll become boring. So you need some contrast to break up that unity, to make your room livelier. For example, you can put bright red cushions on the green sofa, so that the green appears greener next to the red. But you should be careful because too much contrast probably will also destroy the balance by making the room seem busy.

The speaker's logical organization of information and effective use of transitions make the response easy to follow (for example "however, too much of unity is also boring. . . and therefore, comes into picture the second important aspect, which is contrast"). Note that although the speaker makes occasional minor errors in grammar and usage, the meaning remains clear. The influence of the speaker's native language may be heard in the pronunciation and intonation, but he is still easy to understand. The speaker generally uses pauses and stress to communicate emphasis appropriately and make the response easier to follow, for example "what it will bring is [pause] disruption." </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 100.</b></p><p><audio src="track_100.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This response describes unity and contrast and provides examples, but the explanation is not as full and clear as it could be. For example, the speaker describes unity as just using the same colors in a design, rather than similar elements in general, and does not mention the purpose of unity (order and comfort). At times, inaccurate words or phrases make it difficult to guess what the speaker means ("You need contrasting thing to blend [plant?) the application"). The speaker would also benefit from more careful pronunciation in general as some sections are very difficult to understand, thus obscuring her ideas. Overall, the speaker does not communicate her ideas as clearly as the high-level speaker does. </p></div></main></body></html>
