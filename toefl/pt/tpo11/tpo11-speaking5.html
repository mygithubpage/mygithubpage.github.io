So I didn't apply for a dorm room for the summer. I'm afraid it's too late for that now.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, the deadline for campus housing application has already passed. So what are you gonna do now?</p><p>(man) Well, I can stay with my parents. They live two hours from here so I thought I could drive and commute to campus everyday. I know my mom and dad would be happy to have me over for a few weeks and most of my old friends would be home for the summer so, in a way, it'd be fun.</p><p>(woman) Yeah, I understand. But you'd spend quite a bit of time on the road going back and forth. Won't you get tired?</p><p>(man) Yeah, that thought did cross my mind. The other thing I could do is rent an apartment off campus. Besides being closer to work, I'd also save tons of money on gas.</p><p>(woman) Uh, huh. But then you'd have to pay rent.</p><p>(man) I know. There's always something, isn't there?"</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The students discussed a problem and two possible solutions. Briefly summarize the problem then state which of the two solutions you prefer and explain why. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>For this task, the prompt asks you to summarize the man's problem and recommend one of the solutions. Summarizing both solutions is not required and may take up too much of your response time. It is important to offer reasons to support the solution you choose. In this conversation, the man has been offered a summer research position, but he found out about the position too late to apply for campus housing for the summer. He has two possibilities: he can live with his parents (who are far from campus), or he can rent an apartment off-campus. If you recommend the first solution—that he live with his parents and drive to campus everyday—you could provide the reasons for your choice by explaining why the alternate solution is not good. For example, it may be difficult to find an apartment to rent for just a few months. Paying rent for an apartment will probably cost him more than he would pay for gas.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the man's problem is that it's too late for him to apply for a dorm room for the summer so he might have no place to live in. There are two solutions for the man: first, he could stay with his parents; and second, he could rent an apartment off campus. According to my understanding, renting an apartment is a better idea for the man for two reasons. First of all, renting an apartment is what most students do when they could not find a chance to live in a dorm, and for the man, it could save him gas fee for reference books or better food. Secondly, renting an apartment always means one could choose roommate for his or her own preference, especially finding someone who shares almost the same living habits And I am sure the man would like to live with someone he really gets along well with. So I think finding an apartment is a better option.

Even though she mentions both solutions, which is not necessary, she is able to summarize both quickly and allow time for her opinion. She runs out of time at the end, but it does not hurt her response because her opinion is clear and she justifies it well (#... even if the cost is higher because he has to concentrate on this important research project and it will benefit on the long run. . ."). She has a good command of vocabulary; however, she does make some minor grammar mistakes, especially at the end, when she is trying to finish her response. However, for the most part, her response is clear and easy to follow. Overall, she is a fairly fluent speaker, although there is sometimes an unevenness caused by rephrasing or searching for words. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 98.</b></p><p><audio src="track_98.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker does summarize the problem from the conversation, but his explanation is a little unclear ("he didn't hear from his professor or his instructor any-anything so he didn't apply to the dormitory or in campus. ."). He also spends too much time summarizing the two possible solutions, which does not leave him enough time to explain his opinion fully. He does manage to insert his opinion briefly into the summaries of the solutions ("I think it's a headache to drive . . ."), but if he had focused on only including important details from the problem, he would have had more time to develop his opinion. Overall, he has good pronunciation and only minor grammar mistakes, but he also has several very noticeable pauses in his response, which suggest that he is searching for words and not able to give a full response without hesitation.</p></div></main></body></html>
