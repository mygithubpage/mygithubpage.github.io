Without this knowledge we can <span class="highlight">appreciate</span> only the <span class="highlight">formal</span><span class="highlight">content</span> of Egyptian art, and we will fail to understand why it was produced or the concepts that shaped it and caused it to <span class="highlight">adopt</span> its <span class="highlight">distinctive</span> forms. In fact, a <span class="highlight">lack</span> of understanding concerning the purposes of Egyptian art has often led it to be compared unfavorably with the art of other cultures: Why did the Egyptians not develop <span class="highlight">sculpture</span> in which the body turned and twisted <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="highlight">space</span> like <span class="highlight">classical</span> Greek statuary? Why do the artists <span class="highlight">seem</span> to get left and right <span class="highlight">confused</span>? And why did they not discover the geometric <span class="highlight">perspective</span> as European artists did in the Renaissance? The answer to such questions has nothing to do with a <span class="highlight">lack</span> of skill or imagination on the part of Egyptian artists and everything to do with the purposes for which they were producing their art.</p><p>The <span class="highlight">majority</span> of three-dimensional representations, whether standing, seated, or kneeling, <span class="highlight">exhibit</span> what is called frontality: they face straight ahead, neither twisting nor turning. When such statues are viewed in isolation, out of their <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight"><span class="question5">context</span></span> and without knowledge of their <span class="highlight">function</span>, it is easy to <span class="highlight">criticize</span> them for their <span class="highlight">rigid</span> attitudes that remained unchanged for three thousand years. Frontality is, however, directly related to the functions of Egyptian statuary and the contexts in which the statues were set up. Statues were created not for their <span class="highlight">decorative</span> effect but to play a <span class="highlight">primary</span> role in the cults of the gods, the king, and the dead. They were designed to be put in places where these beings could <span class="highlight">manifest</span> themselves in order to be the recipients of <span class="highlight">ritual</span> actions. Thus it made <span class="highlight">sense</span> to show the <span class="highlight">statue</span> looking ahead at what was happening in front of it, so that the living performer of the <span class="highlight">ritual</span> could <span class="highlight">interact</span> with the divine or deceased recipient. Very often such statues were enclosed in <span class="highlight">rectangular</span> shrines or wall niches whose only opening was at the front, making it natural for the <span class="highlight">statue</span> to <span class="highlight">display</span> frontality. Other statues were designed to be placed <span class="highlight">within</span><span class="question6">an architectural <span class="highlight">setting</span></span>, for <span class="highlight">instance</span>, in front of the <span class="highlight">monumental</span><span class="highlight">entrance</span> gateways to temples known as pylons, or in pillared courts, where they would be placed against or between pillars: their frontality worked perfectly <span class="highlight">within</span> the architectural <span class="highlight">context</span>.</p><p>Statues were <span class="highlight">normally</span> made of stone, wood, or metal. Stone statues were worked from single <span class="highlight">rectangular</span> blocks of <span class="highlight">material</span> and retained the compactness of the <span class="highlight">original</span><span class="highlight">shape</span>. The stone between the arms and the body and between the legs in standing figures or the legs and the seat in seated ones was not <span class="highlight">normally</span> cut away. From a <span class="highlight">practical</span><span class="highlight">aspect</span> this protected the figures against breakage and psychologically gives the images a <span class="highlight">sense</span> of strength and power, usually enhanced by a supporting back pillar. By <span class="highlight">contrast</span>, wooden statues were carved from several pieces of wood that were pegged together to form the finished work, and metal statues were either made by wrapping sheet metal around a wooden <span class="highlight"><span class="question9">core</span></span> or <span class="highlight">cast</span> by the lost <span class="highlight">wax</span><span class="highlight">process</span>. The arms could be held away from the body and carry <span class="highlight">separate</span> items in their hands; there is no back pillar. The effect is <span class="highlight">altogether</span> lighter and freer than that achieved in stone, but because both <span class="highlight">perform</span> the same <span class="highlight">function</span>, <span class="highlight">formal</span> wooden and metal statues still <span class="highlight">display</span> frontality.</p><p>Apart from statues representing deities, kings, and named members of the elite that can be called <span class="highlight">formal</span>, there is another group of three-dimensional
representations that <span class="question11">depicts</span> generic figures, frequently servants, from the nonelite <span class="highlight">population</span>.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>The <span class="highlight">function</span> of these is quite different.
 <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Many are made to be put in the tombs of the elite in order to serve the tomb owners in the afterlife.  <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span>Unlike <span class="highlight">formal</span> statues that are limited to <span class="highlight">static</span> poses of standing, sitting,
and kneeling, these figures <span class="highlight">depict</span> a wide <span class="highlight">range</span> of actions, such as grinding <span class="highlight">grain</span>, baking bread, producing pots, and making music, and they are shown in <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> poses, bending and squatting as they carry out their tasks. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span></p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">vital</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. attractive</p><p>B. essential</p><p>C. usual</p><p>D. practical</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Vital: Vital, life and death. A is attractive; B is necessary; C is normal; D is practical and practical. So B's essential is correct, both can replace important. In order to understand ancient Egyptian art, it is vital to know as much as possible of the elite Egyptians' view of the world and the functions and contexts of the art produced for them.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 1 suggests that one reason Egyptian art is viewed less favorably than other art is that Egyptian art lacks</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. a realistic sense of human body proportion</p><p>B. a focus on distinctive forms of varying sizes</p><p>C. the originality of European art</p><p>D. the capacity to show the human body in motion</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>Positioning the keyword to the third sentence with less favorably, and several consecutive question marks after the colon, listed several reasons for the unpopularity of Egyptian sculpture, and the answer must be one of them. The correct answer appears in the first question: In fact, a lack of understanding concerning the purposes of Egyptian art has often led it to be comparable unfavorably with the art of other cultures: Why did the Egyptians not develop sculpture in which the body turned And the twisted through space like classical Greek statuary? The colon says: Why is the body of the Egyptian sculpture not turned and twisted, that is, the body is not moving, so the answer is D. It is easy to choose the wrong one. The D-options are relatively large and difficult to understand. The body proportion of the A option was not mentioned in the original; the varing sizes of the B option were not mentioned; the originality of the C option was not mentioned.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 1, the author mentions all of the following as necessary in appreciating Egyptian art EXCEPT an understanding of</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. the reasons why the art was made</p><p>B. the nature of aristocratic Egyptian beliefs</p><p>C. the influences of Egyptian art on later art such as classical Greek art</p><p>D. how the art was used</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>A's reason corresponds to the original third sentence: In fact, a lack of understanding concerning the purposes of Egyptian art has often led it to comparable unfavorably with the art of other cultures... Correct, not selected; B's aristocratoc Egyptian belief corresponds to the first sentence's elite Egyptian's view, D corresponds to the first sentence of functions:In order to understand ancient Egyptian art, it is vital to know as much as possible of the elite Egyptians' View of the world and the functions and contexts of the art produced for them.</p><p>BD is correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, why are Egyptian statues portrayed frontality?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To create a psychological effect of distance and isolation</p><p>B. To allow them to fulfill their important role in ceremonies of Egyptian life</p><p>C. To provide a contrast to statues with a decorative function</p><p>D. To suggest the rigid, unchanging Egyptian philosophical attitudes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>With the double keywords of status and frontalty pointing to the third sentence, we say that frontality is related to the role of cherishing sculpture, and further in the latter sentence is not to decorate, but it does play some practical role, and in the fifth sentence directly Speaking of the role played: They were designed to be put in places where these being beings could manifest themselves in order to be the recipients of ritual actions. Here it is for ritual actions, so the answer is B,ceremonies and ritual agree to replace Now. A and D are all mentioned in the original text, but they are not related to the problem, so they are not selected. The comparison of C has never been said before, so it is not correct.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight">context</span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. connection</p><p>B. influence</p><p>C. environment</p><p>D. requirement</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Context: background, environment. A is a contact; B is an influence; C is an environment; D is a requirement. So C's environment is correct. The original sentence says when such statues are viewed in isolation, out of their original context and without knowledge of their function, it is easy to criticize them for their rigid attitudes that has remained cheerful for three thousand years. At the time, the phrase is used immediately after the explanation of their original context. Since it is isolated, it is separated from other things, and it only says that it does not know their role, so the answer is separated from the background. . After the connection is replaced, there is obviously a problem with collocation. It should be said that the connection is cut off. It is not the connection, so connection is wrong. As for influence and requirement, it is not reliable.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The author mentions "<span class="highlight">an architectural setting</span>" in the passage in order to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. suggest that architecture was as important as sculpture to Egyptian artists</p><p>B. offer a further explanation for the frontal pose of Egyptian statues</p><p>C. explain how the display of statues replaced other forms of architectural decoration</p><p>D. illustrate the religious function of Egyptian statues</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="an architectural setting B"><p>The purpose of the function, first look at the sentence, said that the other status is mainly placed in the context of the building, because with the emergence of other, indicating that this is just one of several examples, skip all the examples and details, Find the main sentence, that is, the third sentence of the full text: Frontality is, however, the direct related to the functions of Egyptian statuary and the contexts in which the statues were set up. This sentence emphasizes that the reason why the sculpture is frontality is its function and The environment used is relevant. The examples that follow illustrate the functions of sculpture in different environments. So the answer is B, the other explanation corresponds to the original text. Of course, this topic can also be used to draw on the whole theme. The whole paragraph aims at the first sentence and emphasizes frontality. Among these options, there are only B and C related to frontality, and C's replacement is obviously inconsistent with the original content.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "they" in the passage refers to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. statues</p><p>B. gateways</p><p>C. temples</p><p>D. pillared courts</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A refers to looking forward and looking for the subject. The subject of this sentence is statues, so the answer is A, substitute, and correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, why were certain areas of a stone statue left uncarved?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To prevent damage by providing physical stability</p><p>B. To emphasize that the material was as important as the figure itself</p><p>C. To emphasize that the figure was not meant to be a real human being</p><p>D. To provide another artist with the chance to finish the carving</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A uncarved coincides with the not normally cut away in the second sentence of the original text. But this sentence only shows this phenomenon. Looking back, it has two roles. The practical angle can avoid damage. The psychological angle can give people a sense of strength. , A. The answer to prevent destruction is correct when it comes to the first aspect; nothing else is said.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question9">core</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. material</p><p>B. layer</p><p>C. center</p><p>D. frame</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question9">core</span>: The <span class="question9">core</span>, the center. A is material, raw material; B is layer, layer; C is center; D is frame, structure. So C's center is correct. The corresponding text of the By contrast, wooden statues were carved from several pieces of wood that were pegged together to form the finished work, and metal statues were are done by wrapping sheet metal around a wooden <span class="question9">core</span> or cast by the lost wax process. The sentence said that the metal statue was made of metal foil wrapped in what wood; since the bread is a metal, indicating that the wood is the inner <span class="question9">core</span>, so it is the center of the meaning. A material and B layer have no corresponding meaning inside and outside, wrong; D's frame should be outside, and does not match the meaning.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 3, which of the following statements about wooden statues is true?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Wooden statues were usually larger than stone statues.</p><p>B. Wooden statues were made from a single piece of wood.</p><p>C. Wooden statues contained pieces of metal or stone attached to the front.</p><p>D. Wooden statues had a different effect on the viewer than stone statues.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>If you use the wooden statues as a key word, you may need to read a lot, so use the exclusion method. A's larger error, the original did not say who the big or small; according to the third to last sentence, prove that BC is wrong, By contrast, wooden statues were carved from several pieces of wood that were pegged together to form the finished workk, and metal The wooden statues were made of wrapping sheet metal around a wooden <span class="question9">core</span> or cast by the lost wax process. The original wooden sculpture was made up of pieces of splicing, which was inconsistent with B's single pieces. C was wrong. The original saying was that metal was made of wood. The nucleus of the nucleus was wrapped in the skin, and did not say that the metal was attached to the front, belonging to the concept of stealing; D was right, and the effect of the wooden was the last sentence: The effect is altogether lighter and freer than that achieved in stone, but because both This emphasizes that compared to stone carvings, woodcarvings are lighter and freer, so they are different, and by contrast also means that the two are contrasting.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word |<span class="question11">depicts</span>|in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. imagines</p><p>B. classifies</p><p>C. elevates</p><p>D. portrays</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D: depict: Description, de means downward, pict means draw, figure, dye, etc. So D's portray (painting, drawing) is correct. A is an imagination; B is a classification; C is a promotion. The original sentence represents the names of the representation of the entities, kings, and named members of the elite that can be called formal, there is another group of three-dimensional representations thatpresent the generic figures, diligent servants, from the nonelite population. Described outside the elite class, there is also how non-elite class, of course, corresponds to the above represent, is to describe the meaning of the representative, so portray is correct; A imagine the B class C lift lifts do not fly.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 4, what is the difference between statues that represent the Egyptian elite and statues that represent the nonelite classes?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

Statues of the elite serve an important function, while statues of the nonelite are decorative.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B, with the keywords elite and nonelite as the key words to the first sentence, but through the previous question, the first sentence is just to state a phenomenon. It does not say where the two are different, and the correct answer should be in the third sentence. Unlike this statement is the correct answer. People who say formal only have several positions, either sitting or standing, but others are doing all kinds of labor, so B is correct, C is slightly confused, and the difference between the two is mainly static or work.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In fact, it is the action and not the figure itself that is important..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>D Three transition points, adverbs in fact that play transitional conjunctions, two noun actions and figure, according to nouns can determine C or D is correct; but insert C, then can not form in fact reflect the transition meaning, so D correct, The difference between elite and nonelite was stated before, and then the summary is given.
