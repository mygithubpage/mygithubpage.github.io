          <h4 class="w3-center">Outsider Art</h4>
          <p>Outsider Art is a term used to describe art that is made by people who choose to live and work outside society. The artists who produce this kind of art – Outsider Artists – work in isolation from other artists and have little or no formal artistic training. Because they do not learn conventional artistic techniques from teachers or other artists, Outsider Artists must invent their own ways of doing things. As a result of the unconventional methods that Outsider Artists often use, their work can look strange and not at all like traditional art to the observer.</p>

        <h3>Listening Text</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Now listen to part of a lecture in an Art History class.</p>
          <p>(professor) All right, so let's consider the works of outsider artist Henry Dodger. Dodger lived by himself in a tiny apartment in Chicago in the 1900s. He had no friends and spent all his spare time their alone creating hundreds of paintings and drawings. He had never formally studied art and kept his work completely private, so no one ever saw it or responded to it during his life time.And so, when you see Dodger's work you notice how unique it is. It doesn't remind you of anything you've ever seen before. It's very much his own. For example, one piece, it's a water-color painting, in this piece he illustrates a story, about the adventure of seven children. But see, Dodger had a really hard time drawing human figures. Yet he managed to come up with his own rather unique solution for the problem. He simply cut out pictures of children from newspapers and magazines and pasted them into his own painted illustrations of trees, flowers and grass.The results look, um, a little strange. Dodger 's picture looks more cluttered , more crowded with details than the pictures of other artists, because its entire surface is painted and there are no spaces left empty. It's also a lot longer than pictures of most other artists, about nine feet long."</p>

          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>In this item, you need to explain how Henry Darger fits the description of an Outsider Artist as described in the reading passage. Since Outsider Artists live and work outside of society, they produce art that is unusual and is made in ways that are different from other artists. Henry Darger fits this description because he lived and worked alone and taught himself to paint. Therefore his art looked different from other artists' work; for example, in one painting he cut out pictures of children from magazines and put them in his painting (and they also had more detail and were longer than paintings by most other artists). </p>

          <p>The speaker does a very good job of choosing details from the lecture that illustrate why Henry Darger is considered an Outsider Artist. He first describes characteristics of Outsider Artists, then describes how Darger matches these characteristics: "He lived alone; he had no friends . . . he never showed those paintings to anybody; he never studied an. And his work is a unique work, and he has his own style." Occasionally he uses the wrong vocabulary word, such as using "conversation" instead of "lecture," but these errors do not ever make his ideas hard to follow. His response is also fluent, and his pronunciation is almost always easy to understand. </p>

          <p>The speaker organizes her response well, giving two main reasons that Darger was considered an Outsider Artist. However, she does not quite show how living and working alone or lacking a formal art education made him an Outsider Artist—she just seems to be explaining why he is a modern artist. Most of her pronunciation is clear, but sometimes it is difficult to understand certain phrases. She also makes a number of grammar mistakes "that's why he has make a big difference," "his production was totally innovate," "he was a man who were different." Because of how often she makes these mistakes, the listener sometimes has to work harder to follow her ideas.</p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Outsider art is used to describe art works made by people who choose to live and work outside the society. These works are usually very unique because the artists are barely trained. For example, Henry Dodger was an artist who lived far away from people in Chicago in the 1900s, and he had never received any formal artistic education, so his work was very unique. What's more, he didn't have any friends and kept his work private during his lifetime. In one of his water painting that describes the adventure of seven children, he had difficulty drawing figures, so he solved the problem by cutting off figures from newspapers and magazines and pasted them on the illustration of trees, flowers and grass that he painted. As a result, his painting often looks a little strange-more cluttered because its entire surface is painted. And it's also longer than any other works, about nine feet long. That's why Henry Dodger is considered as an outsider artist. (165 words)</p>
