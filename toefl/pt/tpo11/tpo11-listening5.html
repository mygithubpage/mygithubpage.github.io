          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.17" data-time="6.25">[00:06.25]</span>Professor: When land gets developed for human use, the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> changes. <span class="time" data-times="4.36" data-time="10.42">[00:10.42]</span>We don't see as many types of <span class="highlight">vegetation</span>, trees, grasses and so forth. <span class="time" data-times="5.14" data-time="14.78">[00:14.78]</span>This in turn leads to other losses: the loss of animals that once lived there. <span class="time" data-times="6.65" data-time="19.92">[00:19.92]</span>Err...but these are the <span class="highlight">obvious</span> changes, but there are also less <span class="highlight">obvious</span> changes like the <span class="highlight">climate</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.53" data-time="26.57">[00:26.57]</span>One interesting case of this...of...of changes in the <span class="highlight">local</span> land use causing changes in <span class="highlight">climate</span>, <span class="highlight">specifically</span> the <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, is in Florida. <span class="time" data-times="3.81" data-time="36.1">[00:36.10]</span>Now what comes to <span class="highlight">mind</span> when you think of the <span class="highlight">state</span> of Florida?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="39.91">[00:39.91]</span>Student A: Sunshine, beaches.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="42.11">[00:42.11]</span>Student B: Warm weather, oranges...</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.19" data-time="44.77">[00:44.77]</span>Professor: Yes, exactly. Florida has long had a great citric <span class="highlight">industry</span>; large growth of oranges, lemons and the like. <span class="time" data-times="5.04" data-time="51.96">[00:51.96]</span>Florida's winter is very <span class="highlight">mild</span>; the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> doesn't often get below freezing. <span class="time" data-times="2.9" data-time="57">[00:57.00]</span>But there are some areas in Florida that do <span class="highlight">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="7.99" data-time="59.9">[00:59.90]</span>So in the early 1900s, farmers moved <span class="highlight">even</span> further south in Florida, to areas that were <span class="highlight">even</span> less likely to <span class="highlight">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="3.76" data-time="67.89">[01:07.89]</span> <span class="highlight">Obviously</span>, freezing temperatures are danger to the crops. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="71.65">[01:11.65]</span>A bad bout of cold weather, a long spell of frosts could <span class="highlight">ruin</span> a farmer's entire crop.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="7.69" data-time="77.56">[01:17.56]</span>Anyway, before these citric growers moved south, much of the land in south Florida, was what we called wetlands. <span class="time" data-times="11.7" data-time="85.25">[01:25.25]</span>Wetlands are areas of <span class="highlight">marshy</span>, swampy land, areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil for a large part of the year. <span class="time" data-times="7.04" data-time="96.95">[01:36.95]</span>Wetlands have their own <span class="highlight">unique</span> ecosystems, with plants and animals with <span class="highlight">special</span> and interesting adaptations. <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="103.99">[01:43.99]</span>Very <span class="highlight">exciting</span>! But it's not what we are talking about today. <span class="time" data-times="1.72" data-time="107.44">[01:47.44]</span>Emm...where was I?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.2" data-time="109.16">[01:49.16]</span>Student A: Farmers moved south?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="111.36">[01:51.36]</span>Professor: Oh, yes. Farmers moved south. <span class="time" data-times="2.41" data-time="114.02">[01:54.02]</span>But the land was not <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for farming. <span class="time" data-times="7.07" data-time="116.43">[01:56.43]</span>You can't grow oranges in wetlands, so farmers had to <span class="highlight">transform</span> the wetlands into lands <span class="highlight">suitable</span> for farming. <span class="time" data-times="7.68" data-time="123.5">[02:03.50]</span>To do that, you have to <span class="highlight">drain</span> the water from the land, move the water elsewhere, and <span class="highlight">divert</span> to the water sources such as rivers.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.8" data-time="131.18">[02:11.18]</span>Hundreds of miles of <span class="highlight">drainage</span> canals were built in the wetlands. <span class="time" data-times="6.58" data-time="134.98">[02:14.98]</span>Now these areas, the new areas the farmers moved to, used to be warm and <span class="highlight">unlikely</span> to <span class="highlight">freeze</span>. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="141.56">[02:21.56]</span>However, recently the area has become <span class="highlight">susceptible</span> to freezes. <span class="time" data-times="2.35" data-time="145.84">[02:25.84]</span>And we are trying to understand why.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="148.19">[02:28.19]</span>Student B: Is it some global <span class="highlight">temperature</span> change or weather <span class="highlight">pattern</span> like El Nino, or something?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.5" data-time="154.1">[02:34.10]</span>Professor: Well, there are two theories. <span class="time" data-times="5.91" data-time="156.6">[02:36.60]</span>One idea is as you suggest that <span class="highlight">major</span> weather patterns, something like El Nino, are <span class="highlight">responsible</span>. <span class="time" data-times="9.82" data-time="162.51">[02:42.51]</span>But the other idea and this is the one that I personally subscribe to, is that the changes in the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">pattern</span> have been brought about by the loss of the wetlands.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.45" data-time="172.33">[02:52.33]</span>Student A: Well, how would the loss of wetlands make a <span class="highlight">difference</span>?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.39" data-time="175.78">[02:55.78]</span>Professor: Well, think about what we've been studying so far. <span class="time" data-times="3.29" data-time="179.17">[02:59.17]</span>We discussed the <span class="highlight">impact</span> of landscapes on <span class="highlight">temperature</span>, right? <span class="time" data-times="3.71" data-time="182.46">[03:02.46]</span>What effects does the body of water have on an area?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.74" data-time="186.17">[03:06.17]</span>Student A: Oh, yeah. The bodies of water <span class="highlight">tend</span> to <span class="highlight">absorb</span> the heat during the day, and then they <span class="highlight">release</span> the heat at night.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.02" data-time="192.91">[03:12.91]</span>Professor: Yes, exactly. What you just said is what I want you all to understand. <span class="time" data-times="4.2" data-time="197.93">[03:17.93]</span>Bodies of water <span class="highlight">release</span> heat and <span class="highlight">moisture</span> back into the environment. <span class="time" data-times="6.82" data-time="202.13">[03:22.13]</span>So places near large bodies of water are generally milder, err...<span class="highlight">slightly</span> warmer than those without water. <span class="time" data-times="13.85" data-time="208.95">[03:28.95]</span>And what I, another think is that the loss of the wetlands has created the situation where the <span class="highlight">local</span> temperatures in the area are not <span class="highlight">slightly</span> different, <span class="highlight">slightly</span> colder than they were 100 years ago, before the wetland were drained.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.98" data-time="222.8">[03:42.80]</span>Student B: Emm...do we know what the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> was like back then?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.67" data-time="227.78">[03:47.78]</span>Professor: Well, we were able to <span class="highlight">estimate</span> this. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="230.45">[03:50.45]</span>We have <span class="highlight">data</span> about South Florida's <span class="highlight">current</span> <span class="highlight">landscape</span>, emm...the plant cover. <span class="time" data-times="5.28" data-time="235.31">[03:55.31]</span>And we were able to reconstruct <span class="highlight">data</span> about its <span class="highlight">landscape</span> <span class="highlight">prior</span> to 1900. <span class="time" data-times="7.13" data-time="240.59">[04:00.59]</span>Then we enter those <span class="highlight">data</span>, information about what the <span class="highlight">landscape</span> look like before and after the wetlands were drained. <span class="time" data-times="2.72" data-time="247.72">[04:07.72]</span>We enter the <span class="highlight">data</span> into a computer weather model. <span class="time" data-times="2.66" data-time="250.44">[04:10.44]</span>This model can <span class="highlight">predict</span> temperatures. <span class="time" data-times="4.86" data-time="253.1">[04:13.10]</span>And when all the <span class="highlight">data</span> were entered, an <span class="highlight">overall</span> cooling <span class="highlight">trend</span> was predicted by the model.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.3" data-time="257.96">[04:17.96]</span>Student B: How much colder does it get now?</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.3" data-time="260.26">[04:20.26]</span>Professor: Well, actually the model shows a <span class="highlight">drop</span> of only a few degrees Celsius. <span class="time" data-times="3.33" data-time="264.56">[04:24.56]</span>But this is enough to cause <span class="highlight">dramatic</span> damage to crops. <span class="time" data-times="8.02" data-time="267.89">[04:27.89]</span>If temperatures over night are already very close to the freezing point, then this <span class="highlight">drop</span> of just a few degrees can take the <span class="highlight">temperature</span> below freezing. <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="275.91">[04:35.91]</span>And freezing causes frosts, which kill crops. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="279.15">[04:39.15]</span>These damaging frosts wouldn't happen if the wetlands were still in <span class="highlight">existence</span>, just as the tiny <span class="highlight">temperature</span> <span class="highlight">difference</span> can have <span class="highlight">major</span> consequences.</p>
