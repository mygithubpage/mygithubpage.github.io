The theory that land development affected the climate of South Florida.</p><p>D. The importance of the citrus industry to the south Florida economy.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>(starting at 20 seconds)</p><p>Professor: Uh...but these are the obvious changes, but there are also less obvious changes like the climate. One interesting case of this..uh...of changes in the local land use causing changes in in the climate, specifically the temperature, is in Florida .</p><p>[But] appears as a key word. The local land use causing changes in [after], but the temperature, specifically the temperature, is in Florida clearly shows that the subject of the professor is the answer C.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Why does the professor mention the building of canals in the wetlands?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To describe what the wetlands used to look like.</p><p>B. To emphasize that farmers need to transport their crops to other areas.</p><p>C. To explain how the wetlands were transformed into farmland.</p><p>D. To explain why people want to build farms there.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>What I heard before I finally heard the keyword canals and recalled it, and the answer started with the word So.

She does not believe they are the main cause of the changes in Florida's climate.</p><p>B. She is certain that they have caused a worldwide decrease in the number of frosts.</p><p>C. She believes they contributed to the increase of citrus production in Florida.</p><p>D. She does not fully understand what causes them.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The professor's expression this is the one that I personally subscribe means that the answer is behind. The professor's opinion is that the loss of the wetlands is the main cause of Florida climate, not EININO. The A option is the most correct.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What point about bodies of water does the professor emphasize to the students?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Bodies of water in Florida are slightly warmer now than they were 100 years ago.</p><p>B. Bodies of water in south Florida are increasing in size.</p><p>C. Bodies of water release heat back into the environment.</p><p>D. Bodies of water are a source of moisture for crops.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>Yes, exactly! means that the professor fully affirms the student and clearly shows what the student said is the answer.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What data from 100 years ago and today were entered into the computer model that the professor discusses?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

The landscape characteristics of south Florida.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>From hearing the word data to 1900, we can know that the answer to this question is based on this paragraph. The repeated appearance of landscape also prompts us that this is a keyword.
