          <h5>Topic Notes</h5>
          <p>If you agree with the statement, you should present and develop reasons that the quantity of information available is a good thing and has value. <b>1.</b> A reason may include the idea that the Internet has allowed people to learn about topics that they would not have had exposure to before the Internet became widely available. As part of supporting that approach, <b>2. </b> you could explain that some topic you have researched on the Internet would have either been impossible or have taken a very long time to get information about if you were limited to looking up the topic in books at your local library. </p>
          <p>If you disagree with the statement, you should present and develop reasons that the quantity of information now available can be overwhelming and detrimental to learners, consumers, or some other audience. <b>1. </b> A reason may include the idea that many people can't distinguish between good and poor quality information on the Internet, for example, when choosing a particular product to buy, and so they are no better off in terms of getting valuable information about the product than if they had just gone to a shop to ask the salesperson about it.</p>

          <h5>Sample Response</h5>
          <p>It is a fact that in the past few years, the Internet has exploded in terms of size, amount of information and accessibility. </p>
          <p>The usage of the Internet encompasses every aspect of day-to-day life with a few examples being Shopping, News, Weather, Live Webcasts and much more. People who used to rely on traditional sources of information like the radio, TV, Newspapers are now increasingly flocking to the Internet or the "Web" as it's popularly called. </p>
          <p>As more and more people get on the Web, it becomes increasingly effective for companies to use the web to reach out for the consumers. This also applies for Advertisers, Marketers, Content Providers, Newsmakers etc to adopt the same strategies. All the information is now available online and when it all adds up, there is a wealth of information that is now available to whoever seeks to find them. So, I strongly agree with view that the Internet provides people with a lot of valuable information, much more than what is actually necessary. </p>
          <p>Now, providing too much information can also prove to be counter-productive. How does a consumer pick the right information, when there is so much available online? How does he filter to get the data that he needs? Is there a chance that the data he needs is buried somewhere in the middle? It is highly probable, or let me say, this was the case a few years back. So, technically, people were correct when they said too much information also created problems. </p>
          <p>Fortunately, Technology finds ways to make it easier to use an innovation over a period of time. In the last few years, Internet search engines have been getting smarter everyday. They enable a user to enter a search string and then it searches the Internet for the most relevant and appropriate data and presents them to the user, with the results listed in the order of importance. They also offer the user several options to further filter the provided results, making it easier to zone on the correct data.</p>
          <p>In summary, while it is true that there is a lot of not very valuable information on the web, which may be counter-productive for users, there are also means to effectively seek and find the appropriate information, thus providing a great deal of value to people who are looking to learn about a subject, buy the best product for their needs, or any one of many other activities that people need to do nowadays. </p>

          <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
          <p>This 5-level response acknowledges the merits of both positions, while ultimately coming out in favor of the idea that the Internet provides a lot of valuable information. The writer describes some reasons why people use the Internet, explains how helpful it can be for both individuals and companies, and concedes in the fourth paragraph that access to too much information online can be a bad thing. In the fifth paragraph, the writer explains how technology is advancing so that the negative aspects mentioned in the preceding paragraph are becoming less and less problematic. The writer goes on to conclude that in spite of some drawbacks, overall the Internet is quite valuable in what it provides to us. This is a good progression of ideas, and the writer has expressed those ideas by using, mostly accurately, a good range of vocabulary and sentence structure. Errors such as "reach out for the consumers" instead of "reach out to consumers" are minor and do not interfere with meaning. </p>

          <p>Internet must be one of the greatest inventions during the 20th century. It shortens the distance between people all over the world by providing various kinds and large amounts of information. In my point of view, I agree that Internet can provide a lot of valuable information, which would benefit us in the long run without troubling at all.</p>
          <p>By surfing through the Internet, we can get large quantities of useful skills, which can benefit ourselves, from the information that is available on the Internet. Learning these skills can help us keep healthy, gain more money or even improve our living standard. In my country, there used to be some isolated villages, where books and knowledge are hard to spread. People living in these villages lack the basic skills to have a good harvest and they live in the really poor condition. Meanwhile, our government has helped them to have access to the Internet recently and the villagers can get the information they want without any difficulties. By using this information, they improved their living conditions. Therefore, information getting from the Internet can benefit our lives.</p>
          <p>Another important aspect is the current affairs. Internet could offer us a lot of information about things happened all over the world without peopling travelling around the world. From the new scientific discovery to the war in the Middle East, from the economic crisis happened in Europe to the World  Cup  held  in  South  Africa,  things  happened  in  every  corner  of  the  world  can  be  known worldwide in no minute through the Internet. Under this circumstance, people can have their own opinions on these affairs, or they can give their hands to the ones who need help. Internet gives us a chance to learn more about the whole world by proving us information.</p>
          <p>Admittedly, there is some unreal information on the Internet. On the contrary, I do not think it as a trouble at all. The existence of unreal information forces us to be critical thinking and have the ability to tell the truth. In addition, it is the person who creates unreal news rather than the Internet to be blamed.</p>
          <p>All in all, the Internet is a great tool to offer us tremendous amount of information. Surrounded by large amount of information can broad our sight and make us more intelligent rather than trap us into troubles.</p>
