Others think that parents should exercise control over the television programs their children watch. Which do you agree with? Explain why.</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>In this question you need to choose the statement that you agree with and explain why you agree with it. In order to give an effective response, you should provide clear, specific reasons that support your opinion. You will not be scored on which statement you agree with, but rather on how effectively you are able to present and support your opinion. A reason to support the first statement could be that learning to make good decisions is an important part of growing up and rather than restricting a child's viewing, a parent should focus on teaching the child to make good decisions. A reason to support the second statement might include an example of an inappropriate program that parents should not let their children watch and explain why watching that program might have a negative effect on a child.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think parents should exercise control over the television programs their children watch. It's a way of protection, since many shows are full of violent or horrifying scenes. But children are not mature enough to bear those scenes so they may feel terrified. Take myself as an example, When I was 7-year-old, I was watching TV alone at home. I accidentally ran into a horror movie and was frightened by the horrible zombies in the movie. They eat human beings and tear bodies into pieces. I was shocked by the bloody scenes. From then on, I started to be afraid of darkness. Every time I walked along the street in the evening, I would feel a zombie following me. I didn't get rid of the bad influence from that movie until high school.</p></article></div><div><p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 91.</b></p><p><audio src="track_91.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker demonstrates good control in language use and accurately uses a variety of grammatical structures and effective vocabulary. Her pronunciation is clear throughout and her use of intonation is appropriate. She chooses to develop the idea of parental responsibility towards children and explains why she thinks this is important. The response would have been even fuller if she had given an example of a program that is not suitable for young children and why. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 92.</b></p><p><audio src="track_92.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker states his opinion clearly but does not develop his ideas fully with clear support. He does provide a reason for his opinion that children should be able to watch whatever they want: that they can tell real things apart from "not real things." He then repeats the same basic idea in other words with imprecise language: "I sure that a child view television with an enjoy and not with a real situation." The speaker does not demonstrate that he can use a variety of grammatical structures or that he has a wide range of vocabulary. Though an accent is evident, pronunciation is generally clear overall. </p></div></main></body></html>
