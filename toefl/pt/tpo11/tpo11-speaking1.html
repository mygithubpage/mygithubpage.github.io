Explain why you thought the book was interesting. Give specific details and examples to explain your answer.</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>When answering this question, you should choose one book you have read and explain why you found it interesting. You are not required to spend time giving a summary of the book, but you should be sure to provide examples from the book while you are explaining why it was interesting.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Recently, I read an interesting novel named "Keep the aspidistra flying" which is written by George Orwell. I think it's very interesting because in the story the main character's experience is similar to mine. The main character wants to be a poet while I want to be a writer. He abandoned his well-paying job for his dream and I also quit my job for my dream. He had a time when he was impoverished and I also experienced a time when I couldn't afford a lunch. He lives in a society where money talks and I live in a society where money is everything. So these similar experiences make me think the book interesting.</p></article></div><div><p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 89.</b></p><p><audio src="track_89.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>The speaker states the book that she has chosen to talk about and provides two reasons why she likes the book and thinks it is interesting. She does not spend time specifically talking about the story that takes place in the book, but rather focuses on what she likes about the book, and in her description of what she likes, she reveals parts of the story. For example, she provides some description of the book while focusing on answering the question when she says, "I like this because . . . it shows how a boy grows up. . . he's different from others . . the book describes that he's special situation in this world." She also describes characteristics of the book that don't have to do with the story: "The way the writer uh communicate with the readers . . . their beautiful language is um very enjoyable . . ." Although the speaker pauses and hesitates at times during her response and makes minor grammatical errors, it is easy to understand her and follow what she is saying.</p><p><b>Low-level Response: Listen to Track 90.</b></p><p><audio src="track_90.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker does not make it clear that she is talking about a specific book, and it seems that she is talking about a type of book that she enjoys instead. She does not connect her reason for finding this type of book interesting/enjoyable to an actual book, and instead just talks about her own interests. When she does start to try and connect her ideas to a book, she runs out of time, partly due to her slow and choppy pace of speaking: "It's—in the book, it's, it's really interesting is because it's—." Her use of vocabulary is at times imprecise and leads to confusion for the listener, such as when she says, "... the different character and behavior will impact on the decision that they make. . ." She should more precisely have said, "... the different characteristics and how they affect buying behavior." Overall, her response is incomplete and somewhat difficult to follow. </p></div></main></body></html>
