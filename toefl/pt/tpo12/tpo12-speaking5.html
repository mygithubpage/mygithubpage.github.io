I won an award from the Pacific Journalism Institute for an article I submitted, and...</p><p>(man) Doesn't sound like anything's wrong.</p><p>(woman) Well, it's a huge honor to win and there's an award ceremony they've invited me to attend which I am super excited about. But, and here's what's frustrating, I've got a philosophy exam that scheduled to end right when the ceremony begins.</p><p>(man) Uh oh! You're saying you'll just be finishing up taking the exam right when the ceremony starts?</p><p>(woman) Exactly!</p><p>(man) But those ceremonies never start on time, they give long introductions, you know, after a general speech or something before they ever get to handing out awards. I'm sure they won't be ready to hand out your award right at the beginning. Just go when you're done with the test. You won't miss anything important.</p><p>(woman) Maybe,but that's a bit risky. I don't want to miss being there when they announce my name.</p><p>(man) Well, have you talked to you r professor about this?</p><p>(woman) Dr. Forester? No.</p><p>(man) Maybe she'll let you take the test some other time.</p><p>(woman) True. She lets people reschedule exams sometimes. But she always make them take it a couple of days early, that'll mean less studying time for me which I'm not thrilled about.</p><p>(man) Less time to study, Oh!</p><p>(woman) Like I said, I'm still struggling about what to do.</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The speakers discussed two possible solutions to the woman's problem. Briefly summarize the problem then state which of the solutions you recommend and explain why. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>When answering this question, you should start by describing the woman's problem—she has a scheduling conflict. She won an award, but the ceremony to accept the award conflicts with/overlaps with an exam she must take. You are not required to describe the two different solutions, but you should recommend one of the solutions from the conversation (go to the award ceremony right after her exam or reschedule the exam) and provide specific support for your recommendation. For example, you could recommend that she reschedule the exam and take it early, so that she will not have to worry about being late to the ceremony and will not have to rush to finish her exam, which could affect her performance on the exam. There is no "right" solution; that is, you will not be scored based on which solution you choose, but rather on how well you are able to explain the problem and make a clear recommendation for solving it. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>Well, the woman's problem is that she hopes to attend an award ceremony but she has got her philosophy exam exactly before the ceremony. Accordingly, there are two solutions for the woman's problem: first she could try to finish her exam just before the ceremony and hurry to the ceremony just in time; the second solution is that she could talk to the professor to take the test some other time. In such a dilemma I guess she should talk to the professor to get the exam rescheduled and there are two reasons. Firstly, she could try harder studying for her exam exactly from now on, so even if the exam might be rescheduled ahead of time her preparation is even earlier. By studying harder she could get full preparation for both the exam and her attendance of the ceremony that day. Secondly, hurrying to the ceremony would be suffering for both her exam and attendance of ceremony; she could probably get both ruined. So I guess talking to the professor to get the exam time changed is a wiser choice.

She does spend some time providing a brief description of the two different solutions (which is not required), but because she is able to express herself efficiently, she still has plenty of time to provide and justify her recommendation. Her delivery is quite clear; although the listener can hear that her speech is accented, this does not make her difficult to understand. She makes use of complex grammatical structures to support her recommendation ("I would go with the option that she should . . ." and "The reason I say so is that, as her friend mentions, that award ceremonies never start on time"). Although she does make some minor errors ("an philosophy exam:' "secondly being"), these do not prevent the listener from easily following her response. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 131.</b></p><p><audio src="track_131.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker describes the problem and chooses a solution (that the girl talk with her professor in order to take the exam early or later). His solution is mostly clear, though at times issues with vocabulary and grammar make his message somewhat vague and difficult to understand. For example, he says, "... it will be too risky if she get both of them at the same time." This statement would be clearer if he had said, "it would be too risky to take the exam when she needs to be at the award ceremony at the same time." The speaker does make effective use of some complex structures ("If she did that—if she talked with her professor-1 think she would . .") and his pronunciation is understandable without listener effort.</p></div></main></body></html>
