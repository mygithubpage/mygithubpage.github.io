            <span class="time" data-times="4.31" data-time="0">[00:00.00]</span>Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a <span class="highlight">Biology</span> Class.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="22" data-time="4.31">[00:04.31]</span>Professor: As we learn more about the DNA in human cells and how it controls the growth and <span class="highlight">development</span> of cells, then maybe we can explain a very important <span class="highlight">observation</span>, that when we try to grow most human cells in a <span class="highlight">laboratory</span>, they <span class="highlight">seem</span> programmed to divide only a certain number of times before they die.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.02" data-time="26.31">[00:26.31]</span>Now this differs with the type of <span class="highlight">cell</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.79" data-time="30.33">[00:30.33]</span>Some cells, like nerve cells, only divide seven to nine times in their total life. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="37.12">[00:37.12]</span>Others, like skin cells, will divide many, many more times. <span class="time" data-times="4.28" data-time="42.5">[00:42.50]</span>But finally the cells stop renewing themselves and they die. <span class="time" data-times="10.56" data-time="46.78">[00:46.78]</span>And in the cells of the human body itself, in the cells of every organ, of almost every type of <span class="highlight">tissue</span> in the body, the same thing will happen <span class="highlight">eventually</span>.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.2" data-time="57.34">[00:57.34]</span>OK, you know that all of persons' <span class="highlight">genetic</span> information is contained on very long pieces of DNA called Chromosomes, 46 of them in the human cells. <span class="time" data-times="5.38" data-time="69.54">[01:09.54]</span>That's 23 pairs of these Chromosomes of various length and sizes. <span class="time" data-times="7.26" data-time="74.92">[01:14.92]</span>Now if you look at this <span class="highlight">rough</span> drawing of one of them, one Chromosome about to divide into two. <span class="time" data-times="11.81" data-time="82.18">[01:22.18]</span>You'll see that it <span class="highlight">sort</span> of looks like, well actually, it's much more <span class="highlight">complex</span> than this, but it reminds us of a <span class="highlight">couple</span> of springs linked together to <span class="highlight">coil</span> up pieces of DNA.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="12.02" data-time="93.99">[01:33.99]</span>And if you <span class="highlight">stretch</span> them out you will find they <span class="highlight">contain</span> certain genes, certain sequences of DNA that help to <span class="highlight">determine</span> how the cells of the body will develop. <span class="time" data-times="16.09" data-time="106.01">[01:46.01]</span>When researchers looked really carefully at the DNA in Chromosomes though, they were amazed, we all were, to find that only a <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of it, maybe 20-30%, converts into <span class="highlight">meaningful</span> <span class="highlight">genetic</span> information.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="2.97" data-time="122.1">[02:02.10]</span>It's <span class="highlight">incredible</span>; at <span class="highlight">least</span> it was to me. <span class="time" data-times="8.05" data-time="125.07">[02:05.07]</span>But if you took away all the DNA that codes for genes, you still have maybe 70% of the DNA left over. <span class="time" data-times="2.76" data-time="133.12">[02:13.12]</span>That's the so-called JUNK DNA. <span class="time" data-times="3.35" data-time="135.88">[02:15.88]</span>Though the word junk is used <span class="highlight">sort</span> of tongue in cheek.<span class="time" data-times="8.44" data-time="139.23">[02:19.23]</span>The <span class="highlight">assumption</span> is that <span class="highlight">even</span> if these DNA doesn't make up any of the genes, it must serve some other purpose. <span class="time" data-times="11.6" data-time="147.67">[02:27.67]</span>Anyway, if we examine these ends of these coils of DNA, we will find a <span class="highlight">sequence</span> of DNA at each end of every human Chromosome, called a telomere.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.35" data-time="159.27">[02:39.27]</span>Now a telomere is a highly repetitious and <span class="highlight">genetically</span> meaningless <span class="highlight">sequence</span> of DNA, what we were calling JUNK DNA. <span class="time" data-times="6.95" data-time="168.62">[02:48.62]</span>But it does have an important purpose: it is <span class="highlight">sort</span> of like the <span class="highlight">plastic</span> tip on each end of shoelace. <span class="time" data-times="10.92" data-time="175.57">[02:55.57]</span>It may not help you tie your shoe but that little <span class="highlight">plastic</span> tip keeps the rest of the shoelace, the shoe <span class="highlight">string</span> from unraveling into weak and useless threads.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="11.39" data-time="186.49">[03:06.49]</span>Well, the telomere at the end of Chromosomes seems to do about the same thing – protect the genes the <span class="highlight">genetically</span> <span class="highlight">functional</span> parts of the Chromosome from being damaged. <span class="time" data-times="9.93" data-time="197.88">[03:17.88]</span>Every time the Chromosome divides, every time one <span class="highlight">cell</span> divides into two, pieces of the ends of the Chromosome, the telomeres, get broken off. <span class="time" data-times="13.21" data-time="207.81">[03:27.81]</span>So after each <span class="highlight">division</span>, the telomeres get shorter and one of the things that may happen after a while is that pieces of the genes themselves get broken off the Chromosomes.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.64" data-time="221.02">[03:41.02]</span>So the Chromosome is now losing important <span class="highlight">genetic</span> information and is no longer <span class="highlight">functional</span>. <span class="time" data-times="6.51" data-time="227.66">[03:47.66]</span>But as long as the telomeres are at certain length, they keep this from happening. <span class="time" data-times="14.96" data-time="234.17">[03:54.17]</span>So it seems that, when the, by looking at the length of the telomeres on <span class="highlight">specific</span> Chromosomes, we can actually <span class="highlight">predict</span> <span class="highlight">pretty</span> much how long certain cells can successfully go on dividing. <span class="time" data-times="8.15" data-time="249.13">[04:09.13]</span>Now, there are some cells that just <span class="highlight">seem</span> to keep on dividing <span class="highlight">regardless</span>, which may not be always a good thing if it gets out of control.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.77" data-time="257.28">[04:17.28]</span>But when we <span class="highlight">analyze</span> the cells chemically, we find something very interesting, a chemical in them, and an <span class="highlight">enzyme</span> called telomerase. <span class="time" data-times="15.26" data-time="267.05">[04:27.05]</span>As bits of the telomere <span class="highlight">break</span> off from the end of Chromosome, this chemical, this telomerase can rebuild it, can help reassemble the protective DNA, the telomere that the Chromosome is lost.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="9.46" data-time="282.31">[04:42.31]</span>Someday we may be able to take any <span class="highlight">cell</span> and keep it alive functioning and reproducing itself <span class="highlight">essentially</span> forever <span class="highlight">through</span> the use of telomerase. <span class="time" data-times="9999" data-time="291.77">[04:51.77]</span>And in the future, we may have <span class="highlight">virtually</span> immortal nerve cells and immortal skin cells of whatever because these chemical, telomerase can keep the telomere on the ends of Chromosomes from getting any shorter.</p>

              <p>Professor introduced an enzyme present in telomeres: telomerase, telomerase, and ribosomal protease. "This chemical, this telomerase can rebuild it, can help reassemble the protected DNA," Telomerase can repair telomeres, and the B option fits the question. CD has nothing to do. The A option interferes with speech, not resemble. It should be reassemble. The A option means: Telomeres and telomerase are structurally similar.</p>
