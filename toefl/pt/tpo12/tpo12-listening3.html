A way that business managers can better relate to their employees.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The professor introduced the contents of the previous class and then introduced MBWA. "I want to describe a very simple method of researching customer preference." The rest of the options are not mentioned in the text.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the discussion, what is a potential drawback of MBWA?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A.

In many sentences, it can be seen that this sentence is a direct question: "But MBWA is really useful kind of filling in the blanks" Professor did not come to the conclusion of market research and MBWA which is better, BD is wrong. The A option, MBWA, is a microscopic form of market research.

To contrast a successful use of MBWA with an unsuccessful use.</p><p>D. To give examples of how the technique of MBWA is used in practice.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The first two examples in the article, buying soup and buying pants, are successful cases.

To explain the origins of the method of MBWA.</p><p>B. To demonstrate that MBWA can be useful outside the business world.</p><p>C. To provide an example of MBWA can sometimes fail.</p><p>D. To give an example where market research and MBWA provide similar types of information.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Before introducing the example, the professor said: "they have actually been extended to all kinds of different contacts like politics for instance", that is, the use of MBWA has been extended to other areas, such as the political field in the Baltimore example, and this is a Successful example, C wrong.

It is surprising that Dalton's tried to use MBWA.</p><p>B. It is surprising that MBWA was successful for Dalton's.</p><p>C. She does not have a high opinion of the quality of Dalton's soups.</p><p>D.

She must admit that this method is effective. In summary, in fact, the professor adopted this method for large companies such as DALTON, but in fact he was surprised but had to accept it.</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
