Sometimes our perception of these stimuli occurs consciously ,we are aware of a stimulus and know that we are perceiving it. But our perception of a stimulus can also occur without our awareness: an image might appear and disappear before our eyes too quickly for us to notice that we saw it, or a sound might be too faint for us to realize that we heard it. This phenomenon – the perception of a stimulus just below the threshold of conscious awareness – is called subliminal perception. Experiments have shown that subliminally perceived stimuli can influence people's thoughts and attitudes.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo12-speaking4.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now, listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class.</p><p>(male professor) Consider this experiment. Two groups of people were asked to watch TV and while they are watching a picture flashed on the screen less than a second, very quickly so it was barely noticeable.The picture was a boy with a birthday cake. Now, like I said, there were two groups and each group saw a slightly different version of the picture. One group got the boy looking angry, in fact, he was actually throwing the cake on the floor. The other group got a picture of the boy smiling, happy, holding up the cake like he was offering it. Same boy, same cake but different emotions expressed in each picture.Everyone was then asked to look at a different image. Now, this is a third image, right? Again, it's the boy and the cake, but this time the image stayed on the screen. In this picture, the boy's just holding the cake basically no emotion on his face, everything very neutral.Now, remember, nobody knew they'd already seen a picture of this boy. After a minute, everyone was asked to describe the boy's personality. Those who'd been exposed to the image of the angry boy, they generally described the boy's personality negatively. Those who'd earlier seen the happy boy described him, well, positively."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>Describe what subliminal perception is and explain how the experiment discussed by the professor illustrates this phenomenon. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>In this question, you should describe what subliminal perception is, then discuss the specific information from the experiment and explain how it is related to the general idea of subliminal perception. Subliminal perception is the idea that people perceive an image or other stimulus even if they are not aware that they have experienced it. These subliminal perceptions can influence people's thoughts and actions. The professor describes an experiment in which people were subliminally exposed to different photos (an angry or a happy boy) and then shown a second photo of a boy with a neutral expression. Those who had seen the angry boy described the neutral boy negatively, whereas those who had seen the happy boy described the neutral boy positively. This experiment shows that because of subliminal perception, people were influenced by a photo they were not aware of seeing. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The perception of a stimulus just below the threshold of conscious awareness is called subliminal perception. There's an experiment to illustrate this. In the experiment, two groups of people are told to watch TV. Meanwhile the researchers flash two different photos of the same boy through the screen, one with the boy angry, smashing a cake on the ground, while the other one with the boy happy, offering the cake. Anyway, this happens very quickly so that no one in the groups is aware of the photo. Then the researcher shows both groups a third picture of the boy in which the boy's holding the cake without any expression. And the researcher finds that the first group describes the boy negatively while the second group describes him positively. This suggests that even without awareness of the perception, subliminal perception still has impact on people's attitude.

She gives a brief definition of subliminal perception, then describes the experiment in more detail, with good accuracy. She also briefly connects the specific experiment to the general idea of subliminal perception. Although she has a prominent accent, her pronunciation is clear and easy to understand. The response also progresses naturally from idea to idea, making it easier for the listener to follow. Occasional imprecise use of vocabulary or structure (for example, "people who were flashed with a stimulus") does not affect meaning. The speaker also uses self-correction effectively ("one group looked . . . saw the picture . . . the other group looked in. . . looked at a picture"). </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 129.</b></p><p><audio src="track_129.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>Overall, the speaker's pronunciation is good. There is some hesitation at times in the response, but not to the extent that it creates unnecessary effort for the listener. The content at the beginning and middle of the response is good in general, but she is unable to control more difficult structures, resulting in unclear language and confusion ("One teacher was shown with in order to the people during the experiment to watch it just a little amount of time"). Also, although she attempts to summarize the results and connect the experiment to the general idea, she does not describe how the people in the different groups reacted differently (i.e., that one group described the boy negatively and the other group described the boy positively), which is a major omission of the content. </p></div></main></body></html>
