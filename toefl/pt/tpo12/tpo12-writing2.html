It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. </p></section><section><h5>Topic Notes</h5><p>This topic requires that you compare two approaches to knowledge. For either approach you choose to write about, you should present and develop reasons for preferring this approach. As you do so, it may be helpful to identify the particular aspect or aspects of your life in which you think your choice would benefit you most; for example, if you indicate that it is better to specialize, you could explain that this will help you economically ( <b>1.</b> for example, if you are studying to be a doctor and choose certain areas of specialization, you will probably make more money than if you were a general practitioner). By the same token, if you indicate that it is better to take broad knowledge, <b>1.</b> you could explain that this will help you be a well rounded person who can enjoy exploring many interests. If you believe that broad knowledge and specialization are equally important, it might be helpful to explain how having broad knowledge will be very useful in certain aspects of your life, while having specialized knowledge will be very useful in other aspects of your life. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>There are so many people doubting on whether a broad knowledge of many academic subjects take the advantage of specializing in one specific subject.</p><p>We have to realize the fact that the method of learning is more essential rather than the knowledge itself. As we are in the century full of knowledge and information, just absorbing knowledge is not as important as before. However, to learn the way of study requires some training in the subject and of course those who have broad knowledge of many academic aspects can learn more about different ways of learning in different subjects. When given a new task, they can easily solve it by using various methods he has learned, who takes a lot advantage from the learning experience.</p><p>Moreover, the distinction among subjects becomes less clear. In fact, to solve the problem in a certain aspect may use knowledge in other aspects. Thus it leads us to cover more knowledge instead of just specializing in one specific subject. For instance, the subject of biochemistry requires the knowledge of chemistry as well as biology. The one having the background of the two subjects can absorb more and discovery more in doing researches, and have more chances of success.</p><p>In fact, to see the famous scientists in the past, we'll find that most of them specialized in more than one subject. Aristotle, one of the most famous philosophies in ancient Greek, knew a lot about the knowledge in science and did researches on such things. As for Franklin, he discovered the electricity when having storm, and he also did well in his political career. From their experience we will learn that it's not the knowledge of a certain subject contributes to their success, instead, it's their way of thinking and the good personality traits lead to their achievement.</p><p>As the saying goes that knowledge is power, we can draw the conclusion that more knowledge more power.  Anyway there is nothing wrong in learning new knowledge and perhaps one day it can be used in researches or inventions.</p></article></div><article><h5>Sample Response</h5><p>To answer this question it seems to be necessary to make clear, for what aspect of life the knowledge in general should be good. On the one hand you might think that knowledge should be useful for the success in your job or at school. On the other hand you maybe understand knowledge as a part of the human existence, that allows us to think critically and to reflect about our life which includes the whole environment surrounding us. </p><p>I want to respond the question from the second point of view. Knowledge has to be understood as much more than the ability to function in a special kind of business environment. Knowledge is the sum of all the theoretical facts and experiences a human being collects during his or her whole life. And from this position a knowledge as broad as possible must be accepted as the better alternative. </p><p>I think that it will become a very big problem in our society when we continue to concentrate the whole educational system — especially the schools — only on teaching specific subjects. Of course it is actually is very important for young people to have the right preparation for the business world. But as I already said, life must focus on much more than the economic aspect. </p><p>Even if you think that the preparation for the business world should be the main aspect of acquiring knowledge, you should still agree with the statement, because when you really analyse the requirements of work that are typical in our time, you will realize that the technologies and the methods change so quickly, that it would be a very big mistake to concentrate on a specific subject. You would always have the danger that if you concentrate on a specialized part of human knowledge, that part might become completely unimportant in the nearest future. Nowadays it seems to be useful to be able to program computers. Yet in some years computers might have the ability to program themselves. </p><p>When you have a broad knowledge than you will be able to handle all the new things that you might get confronted with. And you will not only be able to handle them — but you will have the possibility to fully understand them and take part in their development. Not only as a passive part but as a creator of your own future. </p><h5>Rater Comments</h5><p>The writer of this 5-level response argues in favor of having broad knowledge. The response begins by examining some different purposes of acquiring knowledge and identifies different areas or aspects of life in which we use knowledge, and then goes on to acknowledge that while acquiring specialized knowledge is useful for success at work or school, it is the other type of knowledge, broad knowledge, which is best to have. In the beginning of the response, this writer has associated this type of knowledge with critical thinking skills. The writer then goes on to argue that if we decide to pursue specialized knowledge, there is the risk that it may become obsolete. The response comes back to the idea of critical thinking skills being most valuable after the writer has presented a scenario about what would happen if somebody pursues the kind of knowledge that the writer is not coming out in favor of in this response. Although the concluding remark contains an error in structure, there are many instances of good facility with language use in the response. </p></article></main></body></html>
