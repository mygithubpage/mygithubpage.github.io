          <p>Jane Austen (1775-1817) is one of the most famous of all English novelists, and today her novels are more popular than ever, with several recently adapted as Hollywood movies. But we do not have many records of what she looked like. For a long time, the only accepted image of Austen was an amateur sketch of an adult Austen made by her sister Cassandra. However recently a professionally painted, full-length portrait of a teenage girl owned by a member of the Austen family has come up for sale. Although the professional painting is not titled Jane Austen, there are good reasons to believe she is the subject. First, in 1882, several decades after Austen's death, Austen's family gave permission to use the portrait as an illustration in an edition of her letters. Austen's family clearly recognized it as a portrait of the author. So, for over a century now, the Austen family itself has endorsed the claim that the girl in the portrait is Jane Austen. Second, the face in the portrait clearly resembles the one in Cassandra's sketch, which we know depicts Austen. Though somewhat amateurish, the sketch communicates definite details about Austen's face. Even though the Cassandra sketch is of an adult Jane Austen, the features are still similar to those of the teenage girl in the painting. The eyebrows, nose, mouth, and overall shape of the face are very much like those in the full-length portrait. Third, although the painting is unsigned and undated, there is evidence that it was painted when Austen was a teenager. The style links it to Ozias Humphrey, a society portrait painter who was the kind of professional the wealthy Austen family would hire. Humphrey was active in the late 1780s and early 1790s, exactly the period when Jane Austen was the age of the girl in the painting. </p>

          <p>Professor：The evidence linking this portrait to Jane Austen is not at all convincing. Sure, the painting has long been somewhat loosely connected to Austen's extended family and their descendants, but this hardly proves it's a portrait of Jane Austen as a teenager. The reading's arguments that the portrait is of Austen are questionable at best.First, when the portrait was authorized for use in the 1882 publication of her letters, Jane Austen had been dead for almost 70 years. So the family members who asserted that the painting was Jane had never actually seen her themselves. They couldn't have known for certain if the portrait was of Austen or not.Second, the portrait could very well be that of a relative of Austen's, a fact that would explain the resemblance between its subject and that of Cassandra's sketch. The extended Austen family was very large and many of Jane Austen's female cousins were teenagers in the relevant period or had children who were teenagers. And some of these teenage girls could have resembled Jane Austen. In fact, many experts believe that the truesubject of the portrait was one of those relatives, Marianne Kempian, who was a distant niece of Austen's.Third, the painting has been attributed to Humphrey only because of the style. But other evidence points to a later date. A stamp on the back of the picture indicates that the blank canvas, you know the actual piece of cloth on which the picture was painted, was sold by a man named William Legg. Record showed that William Legg did not sell canvases in London when Jane Austen was a teenager. He only started selling canvases when she was 27 years old. So it looks like the canvas was used for the painting at a time hen Austen was clearly older than the girl in the portrait. </p>

          <h5>Point Made in the Reading Passage</h5>
          <p>Jane Austen's family members authorized the portrait for use in the 1882 edition of her letters.</p>
          <p>There is a strong resemblance between Cassandra's sketch of Jane and the portrait.</p>
          <p>Although we don't know who painted the portrait, its style is like that of a painter who was active at the same time the Austen family might have hired him to paint a teenaged Jane.</p>
          
          <h5>Contrasting Point from the Lecture</h5>
          <p>Although Jane Austen's relatives did authorize the portrait in question for use with an edition of her letters, so much time had passed since Jane died that none of them would have actually seen the teenaged Jane.</p>
          <p>The portrait could actually be of one of the many female relatives (for example, Mary Ann Campion) who may have resembled Jane, and who were teenagers at the time the portrait was painted.</p>
          <p>A date stamped on the canvas indicates that the canvas was sold by William Legg, who didn't begin selling canvas until Jane was older than the girl in the portrait</p>

          <h5>Sample Response</h5>
          <p>The lecture casts doubt and questions the evidence presented in the reading passage regarding a painting allegedly of Jane Austen.</p>
          <p>First, about the family's recognition of the painting as that of Jane's as a teenager. The lecturer points out that in 1882, when the Austen family authorized the use of the painting as a portrait of Jane in the publication of her letters, Jane had been dead for 70 years. Hence, the family members who claimed this portrait to be of Jane's probably have never seen her, and don't necessarily know how she looked. </p>
          <p>While the reading passage presents the resemblance of the face features to prove that the teenager in the portrait is indeed Jane, the lecturer sees otherwise: the teenager in the portrait could have been any cousin or niece of Jane. The lecturer claims that there was much to the date of the portrait based on the stamp on the canvas itself According to the stamp it was sold by William Legg, who didn't sell canvas in London when Jane was a teenager. He only began selling canvas in London when Jane was 27 years old. </p>
  
          <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
          <p>This response earns a score of 5. It is a well organized response that successfully explains the opposing relationship between the reading and the lecture. The three main points from the lecture are clearly identified, and the writer has provided relevant details for each of those main points. One detail about the second point is presented with a minor inaccuracy — MaryAnn Campion is described by the lecturer as a niece, not a cousin, of Jane Austen — but overall the writer's coverage of this point is sufficient to achieve the highest score. The very few language errors in the response do not interfere with the clear presentation of the essential content from the reading and lecture. </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>The reading passage suggests that three pieces of evidence provide support that a portrait recently commissioned for sale by a member of Jane Austen's family is of Jane Austen herself when she was a teenager. However, the lecturer rejects such evidence and argues that the painting could not be a portrait of Jane Austen.</p>
          <p>First, the lecturer argues that the portrait was approved for publication by the Austen family 70 years after Jane Austen's death, suggesting that members of her extended family might have published the portrait without having actually seen her in person. Therefore. the fact that the portrait had been endorsed by her family members does not necessarily prove that it is a portrait of Jane Austen.</p>
          <p>Second, the lecturer argues that the resemblance between the portrait and an authentic sketch of the adult Jane Austen could be explained by the hypothesis that the portrait is of a relative of Jane Austen when the relative was a teenager.</p>
          <p>Finally, the lecturer argues that despite the style of the painting, which links it to the exact period when Jane Austen was a teenager, the stamp on the back of the canvas suggests that the portrait was painted at least 27 years after Jane Austen's birth, indicating that the portrait was of someone else who was much older than the teenage Jane Austen.</p>
