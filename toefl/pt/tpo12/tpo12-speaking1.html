Explain why you think it is efficient. Include specific reasons or examples.</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>In this item, you should talk about the type of transportation in your country that you think is the most efficient and explain why. You could discuss factors such as speed, cost, or convenience, giving examples for how the type of transportation you chose is preferable in those categories. It is OK to talk about other advantages of that kind of transportation, such as comfort, but you should focus mainly on what makes it most efficient. </p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think airplane is the most efficient type of transportation in my country because it's fast and comfortable. It only takes me three hours to fly from Beijing to Chongqing. This saves me a lot of time. I can go to Chongqing in the morning and come back to Beijing in the evening. However, if I take train or bus, it'll take me at least 20 hours. So it's very fast to take planes. Also, every time I am on the plane, the flight attendant serves me delicious food and drink, all free of charge. But in a train, the attendants aren't very hospitable and you have to pay for all the food and beverage even though they aren't of high quality. So that's why I think taking plane is comfortable.</p></article></div><div><p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 122.</b></p><p><audio src="track_122.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker speaks quite naturally and uses stress and intonation well, which helps the listener to follow and understand his response easily. For example, the way he says, "it's so much easier" helps to make his point about the ease of using a car instead of the bus. He is also able to use rather advanced structures to effectively make this comparison: "compared with the other transportation devices, it's so much faster" (Note that "device" is an incorrect word choice here.) The speaker does hesitate and repeat words at times, but this is not overly distracting. He develops his response well, using the personal example of how long it takes him to get to the movie theater using both modes of transportation. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 123.</b></p><p><audio src="track_123.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>This speaker provides several good reasons and details to justify his choice of the subway as the most efficient. In terms of content, this is a strong response. However, the speaker is hard to follow at times. In contrast to the high-level response, which used stress patterns effectively to convey meaning, this speaker speaks in a flat tone, pausing infrequently and at odd places. This means that the listener has to make an effort to separate his ideas and understand what he is saying. Some mistakes in pronunciation ("scheduled"), misused words ("electronic" instead of "electricity"), and some long hesitations also prevent this response from reaching the high level. </p></div></main></body></html>
