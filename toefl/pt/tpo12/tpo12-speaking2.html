Others don't believe music education is important. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.</p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>When answering this question, you should take a clear stance and explain whether you think that music education or playing a musical instrument is important. You should provide at least one reason to support your point of view and you should explain that reason in detail. It is acceptable to list several reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with the importance of music education, but you should not simply make a list of reasons without providing any support or explanation for them.</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>I think it's essential for a person's education to learn to play a musical instrument. There are two reasons why I say so. First, learning to play a musical instrument can give a person a way to express emotion. For example, I have a sister who can play the piano. Every time she was happy or depressed, she'd play the piano. Second, learning to play a musical instrument makes a person artsy or develop a person's artistic talent. Artistic people are more sensitive than normal ones. They can feel something that others can't feel. They can sense the emotions from what normal people think is a normal scene. For example, Beethoven can compose his Moonlight at night. But I don't think anybody can make a moonlight at night.</p></article></div><div><p><b>High-level Response: Listen to Track 124.</b></p><p><audio src="track_124.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>In this response, the speaker takes an interesting stance by disagreeing with both statements, though he expresses a clear opinion and gives support for that opinion. He believes that music education is important but not essential. He is able to give reasons for his point of view and support for these reasons. He speaks about people who 'have gone through life successfully without having to learn a musical instrument." But he also mentions that learning a musical instrument can help with other skills, such as "logical thinking and math skills," and he references studies which have proven this point. He has some minor hesitations in his speech, but he is able to correct himself easily, and he is very easy to understand. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 125.</b></p><p><audio src="track_125.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>In this response, the speaker agrees that learning to play a musical instrument is essential. The general content of this response is very close to the high-level response, but this speaker does not express her ideas as clearly. She is able to list several reasons for her opinion, but her explanations are sometimes not well developed and therefore not clear ("It's very helpful to develop their brain also because they use in the tip of the fingers, for example, keyboard instrument"). Her pronunciation is mostly clear and easy to understand, but her speech is not always smooth (she pauses frequently and uses words like "um"). Her word choice is sometimes inaccurate ("develop their emotional feeling"), and she makes small grammatical errors, but she mostly communicates her point of view successfully. </p></div></main></body></html>
