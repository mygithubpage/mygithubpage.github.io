Changes would include an expansion of the station's broadcasting range, which would allow the radio's programming to reach nearby towns. One goal of the plan is to attract more students to apply its communications program. Another goal is to provide the university with an extra source of revenue. University officials expect the enhanced radio station to significantly increase the number of listeners, which will in turn encourage businesses to place commercials on the radio.</p></article><div><audio src="tpo12-speaking3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div><article id="listening-passage" class="passage"><h3>Listening Text</h3><p>Now, listen to two students discussing the article.</p><p>(man) What do you think of the proposal?</p><p>(woman) I think it'll work. I mean, the range of the station now is basically limited to the campus. So it's basically just a few programs mainly for students.</p><p>(man) Yeah?</p><p>(woman) Well, if this proposal goes through there will be more programs and it'll give the students more professional experience as they expand the programming for a much larger, you know, real-life audience.

He told me that the radio station at his university did something like this about five years ago.</p><p>(man) And?</p><p>(woman) Well, it's a success! They are making a lot of money out of commercials and they are using it to offer more scholarships and to help fund projects to renovate the facilities of other programs.</p><p>(man) That sounds really good."</p></article><section id="question"><h4>Question</h4><p>The woman supports the proposal described in the article. Explain why she thinks it will achieve the university's goals. </p></section><section><h5>Important Points</h5><p>In your answer to this prompt, you should explain that the woman thinks the proposal to expand the student radio station will attract more students to the communications program and allow the university to make money. She thinks that more students will be attracted to the communications program because the proposed changes would allow the radio station to reach a larger audience, which will enable students to get real-life work experience and get better jobs when they graduate. She also thinks that the changes to the radio station will allow the university to make extra money by adding commercials. The extra money made from commercials can be used to offer more scholarships or to help fund other projects in the program. Note that it is not necessary to explain the technical aspects of expanding the broadcasting range of the radio station, as long as it's clear that the changes will allow the station to reach a larger audience.6</p></section><div id="responses"><article class="response"><h4>Sample Response</h4><p>The woman agrees with the proposal and believes that it will achieve the university's goals for two main reasons. First of all, she believes that there will be more programs than there used to be, and it'll offer students more professional experience since the programming will be directed to larger and real-life audience, which will give students better chance for job-hunting after graduation. The second reason form the woman is that the whole university will benefit from the proposal too. She quotes her friend's university that did the same thing like five years ago and points out that it turned out to be a success since such a change actually made a lot of money, and her friend's university put the money into the field of scholarships and renovation of the facilities of other programs as well. So based on the reasons stated above, the woman agrees that such a proposal will help the university meeting its goals.

Both goals (improving job prospects for students and generating money through commercials) are addressed with an appropriate level of detail. The response is well organized, and makes logical connections between the plan and its effects ("the staff will have. . . a better chance of getting a job, because it'll promote interacting with people that are not only students, but people who live in nearby towns.") The idea of expanding the radio station is implied rather than directly stated ("right now it is only limited to campus and campus students"), but this is acceptable for this particular item since the prompt does not ask the speaker to describe the plan. Although the speaker occasionally pauses to think, he speaks for long, fluid stretches between pauses, using appropriate intonation to express meaning. He uses precise vocabulary and complex structures accurately throughout. </p><p><b>Mid-level Response: Listen to Track 127.</b></p><p><audio src="track_127.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></p><p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p><p>Although the speaker addresses all of the points and is understandable, vagueness and simple language keep this response in the middle range. For example, when the speaker says "more program would provide for opportunity for more students to have a real experience of what that is" the listener has to guess what "that" refers to. The speaker also tends to repeat things instead of elaborating on them. For example, after the sentence quoted above, he adds "and then they would have — get more jobs after they finish it because they get experience of doing it" instead of adding details like the fact that the station's wider range would allow students to work with a different type of audience. Sometimes the speaker's sentence structure limits his ability to express himself and make connections between pieces of information. For example, in "they also get more money out of it because of the commercials", it would be better to say something like, "the radio station would also be able to earn more money because their wider audience would allow them to attract more commercials." </p></div></main></body></html>
