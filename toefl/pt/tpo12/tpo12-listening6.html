An efficient solution to the problem of storing solar energy.</p><p>B. Energy policies in the twentieth century.</p><p>C. Reasons that solar energy is not more widely used.</p><p>D. The superiority of solar energy to oil and natural gas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>The lecture introduced the history and status quo of solar energy utilization, explained the shortcomings of solar energy, and explained the reasons why solar energy could not be widely used. So C is correct. The article does not describe any method of storing solar energy. A is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>What are the two main problems solar power presents as an energy source? Click on two answers</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. It is a potentially dangerous source.</p><p>B. It is difficult to concentrate.</p><p>C. It is scientifically unsound.</p><p>D. It needs to be stored.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>Because it is hard to gather it? (B option)</p><p>Solar energy is everywhere, but it's also quite diffused. (D option)</p><p>According to the original text, the two biggest problems of solar energy are storage and collection, which occurred when Professor Wen answered the students' questions twice.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to the professor, what led to the popularity of solar energy in the 1970's?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. New solar energy technologies.</p><p>B. Advertising campaigns by solar energy companies.</p><p>C. An increase in the price of oil and natural gas.</p><p>D. The depletion of Earth's reserves of oil and natural gas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>So what happened in the 1970s was oil and natural gas became very expensive very quickly, and that spurred people to start looking into other alternative forms of energy, solar energy probably being the most popular.</p><p>It is because of the rise of oil and natural gas. Select C.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the difference between passive and active heating systems?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Passive systems are less reliable.</p><p>B. Passive systems are difficult to install.</p><p>C. Passive systems can be used at any location.</p><p>D. Passive systems work without mechanical support.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>It can be seen that the passive system is not dependent on any mechanical equipment for its help. So D is correct. The location restrictions of the two systems are not mentioned in the article, so the C option is wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What is the professor's opinion about the future of Kramer Junction power plant?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He is uncertain about the future of the Kramer Junction plant.</p><p>B. He believes the Kramer Junction plant will become a major source of power.</p><p>C. He is certain the Kramer Junction plant will not be able to increase its capacity.</p><p>D. He thinks the Kramer Junction plant will have many competitors.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Professor only introduced the major source of power for that region, considering the economic and political factors involved. Professor finally introduced KJ, which is a solar power plant. When referring to its prospects, The professor said that "only time will tell." He is not sure about his future, so choose A. None of the remaining options are mentioned.</p></div></div><div class="replay" id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>What does the professor mean when he says that?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. He thinks the student should know the answer.</p><p>B. He thinks the student has raised an important issue.</p><p>C. He wants the student to repeat his question.</p><p>D. He will answer the question later in the lecture.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>That's...Well...that is a really good question. The student asked how solar energy was used when wood had the sun and taught him to stutter. Later on it was also acknowledged that this was a problem that could not be solved for the time being and it was also an important issue. According to the semantic understanding of the hard-of-hearing part, B is correct. .</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
