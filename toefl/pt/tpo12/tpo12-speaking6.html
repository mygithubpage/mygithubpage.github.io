        <article>
          <p>Listen to part of a lecture in an economics class.</p>
          <p>(female professor) So, when we talked about the demand for a product, we're referring to how much consumers want to buy it, right? And often the demand for a product is influenced by its price, the more expensive it becomes the less chance people want to buy it.OK, but that's not the whole story. Sometimes the demand for a product can also be influenced by the price of other related products.First, there are other products called "substitute goods". If products can be substituted for one another then, um, well, then they are called substitute goods. They are similar enough to be interchangeable. And, uh, the increase of price of one means the increase for the demand of the other. Like, uh, like butter and margarine. They are pretty much used for the same purposes. Margarine's butter's substitute and you can bake equally well with either. Well, when the price of butter goes up, it becomes less affordable, and so what do people do? They buy margarine instead, right? So, uh, you see, increase of the price of butter increases the demand for margarine. Now, another instance with the price of one product can influence the demand of another is, uh, is when you have two products that can't be used without each other. Those products we call "compliment goods". They compliment, or complete, each other, if you will. Like compact disks and compact disk players. You need both products in order to use either. So if the price of either product increases demand for both is likely to decrease. And if the price of the CD's goes up, well, demand for them will do down, right? And because CD's and CD player compliment each other, what will also happen is that the demand for CD player will go down, too."</p>

          <h5>Important Points</h5>
          <p>In this item, you need to explain the ways the two kinds of goods—substitute goods and complement goods—have an effect on the demand for particular products. You should use the examples of butter and margarine and of CDs and CD players to help explain the effect. Substitute goods are products that are similar enough to be interchangeable, so the price of one will influence the demand for the other. For example, margarine and butter are substitute goods, so if the price goes up for butter, then the demand goes up for margarine, which can be used as a butter substitute. Complement goods are those in which two products can't be used without the other, so the price of one will influence the demand for both in the same way. For instance, compact discs (CDs) and CD players are complement goods. If the price of CDs goes up, the demand will go down not only for CDs, but also for CD players. </p>

          <p><b>Rater’s Comments</b></p>
          <p>The speaker does a good job of explaining the two kinds of goods and of using the examples to explain how they each affect the demand. It is easy to follow the organization of her ideas and her pronunciation is mostly quite clear. She mispronounces the words "butter" and "margarine," but it is still possible to understand her response. While her grammar contains some minor errors, in other areas she is able to use fairly difficult grammatical constructions easily, such as "she stated an example. . saying that if the price of the CD goes up, then the demands for both the CD and the CD players will go down." There are a few hesitations during her response as she pauses to consider what to say, but they do not interfere greatly with the flow of her response. </p>

          <p>The speaker does a fairly good job of explaining substitute goods and their effect on demand, but she runs out of time before she can finish talking about complement goods. She also never mentions the examples the professor gave. If she had not included an unnecessary introduction at the beginning— explaining that the professor is talking about economic theory in an economics class—she would have had a bit more time to finish discussing what the prompt required. Her speech also contains many hesitations, so listeners have to make an effort to follow her ideas. In addition, her response contains numerous minor grammatical errors, such as "one goods," "substitute of another," and "the two good." </p>

        <h4>Sample Response</h4>
        <article>
          <p>Sometimes the demand of a product can be influenced by the price of related product, and there're two types of those interrelated products. The first is called substitute goods, which means the two products can replace each other. So when the price of one goes up, the demand for the other goes up,too. Take butter and margarine. If the price of butter increases, and is therefore increasingly unaffordable for people, people will begin to buy more margarine, which means the demand for margarine goes up. Another is complement products. That is, either one of the two products can not be used until with the other. For example, compact disc and disc player are complement product, and you cannot use compact disc without a player. The demand for both will decrease if either of them becomes more expensive. For instance, if the price of CD increases, the demand of CD player will go down. (152 words)</p>
