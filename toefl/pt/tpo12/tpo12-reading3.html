An <span class="highlight">annual</span><span class="highlight">rainfall</span> of four inches is often used to <span class="highlight">define</span> the limits of a <span class="highlight">desert</span>. The <span class="highlight">impact</span> of <span class="highlight">rainfall</span> upon the surface water and <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> resources of the <span class="highlight">desert</span> is greatly influenced by landforms. Flats and depressions where water can <span class="highlight">collect</span> are <span class="highlight">common</span> features, but they make up only a small part of the <span class="highlight">landscape</span>.</p><p><span class="highlight">Arid</span> lands, surprisingly, <span class="highlight">contain</span> some of the world's largest river systems, such as the Murray-Darling in Australia, the Rio Grande in North America, the Indus in Asia, and the Nile in Africa. These rivers and river systems are known as "exogenous" because their sources lie outside the <span class="highlight">arid</span><span class="highlight">zone</span>. They are <span class="highlight">vital</span> for sustaining life in some of the driest parts of the world. For centuries, the <span class="highlight">annual</span> floods of the Nile, <span class="highlight">Tigris</span>, and <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span>, for example, have brought <span class="highlight">fertile</span> silts and water to the inhabitants of their <span class="highlight">lower</span> valleys. Today, river discharges are increasingly controlled by human intervention, creating a need for international river-basin agreements. The filling of the Ataturk and other dams in <span class="highlight">Turkey</span> has <span class="highlight"><span class="question2">drastically</span></span> reduced flows in the <span class="highlight">Euphrates</span>, with potentially serious consequences for Syria and Iraq.</p><p>The flow of exogenous rivers varies with the <span class="highlight">season</span>. The <span class="highlight">desert</span> sections of long rivers <span class="highlight">respond</span> several months after rain has fallen outside the <span class="highlight">desert</span>, so that <span class="highlight">peak</span> flows may be in the dry <span class="highlight">season</span>. This is useful for <span class="highlight">irrigation</span>, but the high temperatures, low humidities, and different day lengths of the dry <span class="highlight">season</span>, compared to the normal growing <span class="highlight">season</span>, can present difficulties with some crops.</p><p>Regularly flowing rivers and streams that <span class="highlight">originate</span><span class="highlight">within</span><span class="highlight">arid</span> lands are known as "endogenous." These are generally fed by <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> springs, and many <span class="highlight">issue</span> from <span class="highlight">limestone</span> massifs, such as the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Basaltic rocks also support springs, <span class="highlight">notably</span> at the Jabal Al-Arab on the Jordan-Syria <span class="highlight">border</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="A"></span>Endogenous rivers often do not <span class="highlight">reach</span> the sea but <span class="highlight">drain</span> into inland basins, where the water evaporates or is lost in the ground. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="B"></span>Most <span class="highlight">desert</span> streambeds are <span class="highlight">normally</span> dry, but they occasionally receive large flows of water and <span class="highlight">sediment</span>. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="C"></span></p><p>Deserts <span class="highlight">contain</span> large amounts of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> when compared to the amounts they hold in surface stores such as lakes and rivers. <span class="insert-area" data-answer="D"></span>But only a small <span class="highlight">fraction</span> of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> enters the hydrological <span class="highlight">cycle</span>-feeding the flows of streams, maintaining lake levels, and being recharged (or refilled) <span class="highlight">through</span> surface flows and rainwater. In recent years, <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> has become an increasingly important <span class="highlight">source</span> of freshwater for <span class="highlight">desert</span><span class="question5">dwellers</span>. The United Nations Environment Program and the World Bank have funded attempts to <span class="highlight">survey</span> the <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> resources of <span class="highlight">arid</span> lands and to develop <span class="highlight">appropriate</span> extraction techniques. Such programs are much needed because in many <span class="highlight">arid</span> lands there is only a <span class="highlight">vague</span> idea of the <span class="highlight">extent</span> of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> resources. It is known, however, that the <span class="highlight">distribution</span> of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span> is <span class="highlight">uneven</span>, and that much of it lies at great depths.</p><p><span class="highlight">Groundwater</span> is stored in the <span class="highlight">pore</span> spaces and joints of rocks and <span class="highlight">unconsolidated</span> (unsolidified) sediments or in the openings widened <span class="highlight">through</span><span class="question7">fractures</span> and <span class="highlight">weathering</span>. The water-saturated rock or <span class="highlight">sediment</span> is known as an "aquifer". Because they are <span class="highlight">porous</span>, <span class="highlight">sedimentary</span> rocks, such as sandstones and conglomerates, are important <span class="highlight">potential</span> sources of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span>. Large quantities of water may also be stored in limestones when joints and cracks have been enlarged to form cavities. Most <span class="highlight">limestone</span> and sandstone aquifers are deep and <span class="highlight">extensive</span> but may <span class="highlight">contain</span> groundwaters that are not being recharged. Most <span class="highlight">shallow</span> aquifers in sand and <span class="highlight">gravel</span> deposits produce <span class="highlight">lower</span> yields, but they can be rapidly recharged. Some deep aquifers are known as "<span class="highlight">fossil</span> waters. The <span class="highlight">term</span> "fossil" describes water that has been present for several thousand years. These aquifers became saturated more than 10,000 years ago and are no longer being recharged.</p><p>Water does not <span class="highlight">remain</span><span class="question10">immobile</span> in an <span class="highlight">aquifer</span> but can <span class="highlight">seep</span> out at springs or <span class="highlight">leak</span> into other aquifers. The <span class="highlight">rate</span> of movement may be very slow: in the Indus <span class="highlight">plain</span>, the movement of saline (salty) groundwaters has still not reached <span class="highlight">equilibrium</span> after 70 years of being tapped. The <span class="highlight">mineral</span><span class="highlight">content</span> of <span class="highlight">groundwater</span><span class="highlight">normally</span> increases with the depth, but <span class="highlight">even</span> quite <span class="highlight">shallow</span> aquifers can be highly saline.</p></article><div id="questions"><div id="question1" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following statements about annual rainfall can be inferred from paragraph 1?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Flat desert areas receive more annual rainfall than desert areas with mountains.</p><p>B. Areas that receive more than four inches of rain per year are not considered deserts.</p><p>C. Many areas receive less than four inches of annual rainfall, but only a few are deserts.</p><p>D. Annual rainfall has no impact on the groundwater resources of desert areas.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. Positioning to the second sentence with an annual rainfall keyword, said that where the annual rainfall is less than 4 inches is considered to be a desert, it is inferred that the opposite is where the annual rainfall is greater than 4 inches, which is not a desert, that is, B.</p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question2">drastically</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. obviously</p><p>B. unfortunately</p><p>C. rapidly</p><p>D. severely</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D <span class="question2">drastically</span>: thoroughly and fiercely. A is obviously; B is unfortunately; C is fast; D is fiercely. So D's severely correct.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>In paragraph 2, why does the author mention the Ataturk and other dams in Turkey?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. To contrast the Euphrates River with other exogenous rivers</p><p>B. To illustrate the technological advances in dam building</p><p>C. To argue that dams should not be built on the Euphrates River</p><p>D. To support the idea that international river-basin agreements are needed</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The purpose of the function, the two details of the sentence is simply to say an example, look forward, that the river flow is more and more controlled by people, making the need for an agreement, so the answer is D, need agreement.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 2, which of the following is true of the Nile River?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The Nile's flow in its desert sections is at its lowest during the dry season</p><p>B. The Nile's sources are located in one of the most arid zones of the world</p><p>C. The Nile's annual floods bring fertile silts and water to its lower valley</p><p>D. The Nile's periodic flooding hinders the growth of some crops</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Use Nile to target the first sentence and the fourth sentence. In the first sentence, the Nile is just an example. So in the fourth sentence, the answer is that the Nile River flooded valleys with water and water, which is exactly the same as C, so the answer is It is C.</p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question5">dwellers</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. settlements</p><p>B. farmers</p><p>C. tribes</p><p>D. inhabitants</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" D"><p>D dwell: Settled. So dweller is the meaning of the residents. A is settled; B is a peasant; C is a tribe; D is a resident. So D's inhabitants are correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Paragraph 5 supports all of the following statements about the groundwater In deserts EXCEPT:</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The groundwater is consistently found just below the surface</p><p>B. A small part of the groundwater helps maintain lake levels</p><p>C. Most of the groundwater is not recharged through surface water</p><p>D. The groundwater is increasingly used as a source of freshwater</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A EXCEPT questions, exclusion. A in the original text does not correspond to, wrong, election; B's lake level keyword positioning to the second sentence, small fraction and small part synonymous replacement, correct, not selected; C surface water and the second sentence of the same surface flow Meaning replace, correct, not selected; D's freshwater keyword positioning to the third sentence, correct, not selected.</p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question7">fractures</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. streams</p><p>B. cracks</p><p>C. storms</p><p>D. earthquakes</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" B"><p>B fracture: <span class="question7">fractures</span>, cracks, cracks. A is a stream; B is a crack; C is a storm; D is an earthquake. So B's crack is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, which of the following statements about aquifers in deserts is true?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. Water from limestone and sandstone aquifers is generally better to drink than water from sand and gravel aquifers</p><p>B. Sand and gravel aquifers tend to contain less groundwater than limestone or sandstone aquifers</p><p>C. Groundwater in deep aquifers is more likely to be recharged than groundwater in shallow aquifers</p><p>D. Sedimentary rocks, because they are porous, are not capable of storing large amounts of groundwater</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>B. You may need to read more articles using auifer keyword positioning, and use the exclusion method faster. A limestone keyword positioning to the fifth sentence, but this sentence does not say drink thing, so A wrong; B sand and gravel keyword positioning to the penultimate sentence, said the low production of sand and aquifer water , but it's easier to recharge. The first sentence says limestone and sandstone, which means that the high is the two, so B is correct, and C is anti- ; D of the sedimentary rocks do keyword positioning to the third sentence, should be able to store, options Say it wrong, wrong.</p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>According to paragraph 6, the aquifers called fossil waters</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. contain fossils that are thousands of years old</p><p>B. took more than 10,000 years to become saturated with water</p><p>C. have not gained or lost any water for thousands of years</p><p>D. have been collecting water for the past 10,000 years</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C. Positioning the word from the fossil waters to the bottom three sentences. The water layer containing fossil water was spontaneously rehydrated as early as a thousand years ago. The answer is C. This sentence was saturated 10,000 years ago, so B's Ten thousand years before it became saturated and D, the water that had gathered for 10,000 years was not right; A was completely indecisive.</p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The word "<span class="highlight"><span class="question10">immobile</span></span>" in the passage is closest in meaning to</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. enclosed</p><p>B. permanent</p><p>C. motionless</p><p>D. intact</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer=" C"><p>C <span class="question10">immobile</span>: Immovable, unchanging. A is closed; B is permanent; C is incomprehensible; D is complete. So C's motionless is correct.</p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The passage supports which of the following statements about water in the desert?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A. The most visible forms of water are not the most widespread forms of water in the desert.</p><p>B. Groundwater in the desert cannot become a source of drinking water but can be used for irrigation.</p><p>C. Most of the water in the desert is contained in shallow aquifers that are being rapidly recharged.</p><p>D. Desert areas that lack endogenous or exogenous rivers and streams cannot support life.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>A asks the entire passage, so the elimination is best, and you should focus on the beginning of each segment. At the beginning of the fifth paragraph, A's message said that the amount of water in the desert is greater than that of rivers and lakes, while rivers and lakes are the most common forms of water, but not the most, so A is correct; B is wrong, and the third paragraph of the original text Speaking of being able to irrigate, but did not say can not drink, wrong; C's rapid recharged and apparently the sixth paragraph of the fifth sentence is not recharge the contrary; D original did not say.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>These sudden floods provide important water supplies but can also be highly destructive..</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A</p><p>B</p><p>C</p><p>D</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>C, the three transition points, are the pronouns, noun water supplies and noun flood, flood is synonymous with the large flows of water in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the source text, so B or C may be correct, but these can determine C pairs because Before these floods must be said flood, just in front of large flows of water to meet the requirements.</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="table"><div class="question"><p>Select from the seven sentences below, the two sentences that correctly characterize endogenous rivers and the three sentences that correctly characterize exogenous rivers.
