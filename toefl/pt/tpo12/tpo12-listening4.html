            <span class="time" data-times="4.1" data-time="28.68">[00:28.68]</span>Secretary: They are. Let's see did you complete all the forms for the payroll? </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="5.23" data-time="66.4">[01:06.40]</span>Secretary: I don't know how they work over there, 'cause they couldn't <span class="highlight">even</span> <span class="highlight">figure</span> out whose information was missing. <span class="time" data-times="4.07" data-time="71.63">[01:11.63]</span>And this isn't the first time, seems like something like this happens every <span class="highlight">semester</span>. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.04" data-time="83.33">[01:23.33]</span>Student: Well, then let me to do...? </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="5.48" data-time="85.37">[01:25.37]</span>Secretary: Sorry, but you will need to fill out those forms again and then I will fax them over the payroll office. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="4.19" data-time="90.85">[01:30.85]</span>Student: And then what... Well, what I really need to know is how long till I get the money. <span class="time" data-times="3.49" data-time="95.04">[01:35.04]</span>I'm already a month behind my bills and my tuitions <span class="highlight">due</span> soon. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.24" data-time="98.53">[01:38.53]</span>Secretary: They'll get you into the system the same day they receive your paper works. <span class="time" data-times="3.22" data-time="101.77">[01:41.77]</span>So if you do that tomorrow, you'll get paid next Friday. </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="1.8" data-time="104.99">[01:44.99]</span>Student: That's a long time from now. <span class="time" data-times="2.4" data-time="106.79">[01:46.79]</span>Will that <span class="highlight">pay</span> checking include all the money I am owed? </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.3" data-time="112.33">[01:52.33]</span>Student: And another thing, Is there any way I could get paid sooner? <span class="time" data-times="2.09" data-time="115.63">[01:55.63]</span>I have been teaching all these weeks... </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="6.52" data-time="117.72">[01:57.72]</span>Secretary: I know that's not <span class="highlight">fair</span> but I don't think they can do anything; all the checks are computed automatically in the system. <span class="time" data-times="2.25" data-time="124.24">[02:04.24]</span>They can't just write checks. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="2.08" data-time="126.49">[02:06.49]</span>Student: But they are the ones that have made mistakes. <span class="time" data-times="1.57" data-time="128.57">[02:08.57]</span>And they never told me! </p>
          <p>
            <span class="time" data-times="3.97" data-time="130.14">[02:10.14]</span>Woman: I understand how you feel and if I were you, I'd be <span class="highlight">upset</span> too. <span class="time" data-times="5.8" data-time="134.11">[02:14.11]</span>I'll tell you what: when I call them, I will explain the situation and ask them if there is any way you can be paid sooner. <span class="time" data-times="4" data-time="139.91">[02:19.91]</span>But I have to tell you that <span class="highlight">base</span> on past experiences, you shouldn't <span class="highlight">count</span> on it. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="3.34" data-time="143.91">[02:23.91]</span>Student: (Sigh) I understand, thanks. <span class="time" data-times="3.19" data-time="147.25">[02:27.25]</span>I know it's not your <span class="highlight">fault</span> and that you're doing everything you can. </p>

            <span class="time" data-times="6.35" data-time="150.44">[02:30.44]</span>Secretary: Well, what I can do is: make sure that your first <span class="highlight">check</span> is for total <span class="highlight">amount</span> the university owes you. </p>
