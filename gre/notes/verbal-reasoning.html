          <h4>Text Completion</h4>
          <p>Your task is to use the <b>context</b> of the sentence to select the choice that best fits in the blank.  The best method is to <b>predict the answer</b> and then see which choice matches your prediction by identifying the <b>contextual clues</b>. Contextual clues are words or phrases that link elements of a sentence. These clues help provide a logical structure for understanding the relationship between the sentence’s different components.</p>

          <p>Contextual clues will typically fall into three categories: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast signals:</b> but, yet, nonetheless, nevertheless, despite, in spite of, in contrast, contrasted with, opposed to, although, however, on the contrary, rather than, still, though</li>
            <li><b>Continuity signals:</b> indeed, and, also, moreover, furthermore, in addition, in fact, semicolon (;), colon (:)</li>
            <li><b>Cause-effect signals:</b> thus, therefore, consequently, due to, because, since, as a result, hence, so</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Let’s look at the steps for answering a typical Text Completion question.</p>
          <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Contextual Clue</b></p>
          <p><b>Step 2: Determine the Contextual Clue’s Relationship with the Rest of the Sentence</b></p>
          <p><b>Step 3: Predict Your Own Word for the Blank From Step 2</b></p>
          <p><b>Step 4: Select the Answer That Best Matches Your Prediction</b></p>

        <section>
          <h4>Sentence Equivalence</h4>
          <p>However, one key difference between the two question types is the fact that you must select <b>two</b> words for the blank in Sentence Equivalence questions. Though it might appear that this format makes Sentence Equivalence questions more difficult, you can take advantage of this fact by recognizing that <b>the correct answers will almost always be synonyms</b>. </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Reading Comprehension</h4>
          <p>Of the 20 questions that you will see in each scored Verbal section, approximately 9 will be Reading Comprehension questions.  Reading Comprehension questions can be divided into two categories:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>Information-based passages.</b> These passages can be classified as “long” or “short.” A <b>long</b> passage is generally <b>three to four paragraphs</b> and 500+ words. Each long passage will have <b>four associated questions</b>. You can expect to see <b>one long passage</b> on your test. A <b>short</b> passage is generally <b>one to two paragraphs</b> and 100 to 300 words. Each short passage will have <b>one to four associated questions</b>, though most of the time there will be two or three questions. You can expect to see <b>five to six short passages</b> on your test. </p>
              <p>For both long and short passages, the questions concern <u>the meaning of the passage</u>, <u>the author’s purpose</u>, <u>details about the passage</u>, <u>inferences that can be drawn from the passage</u>, and <u>application of the passage’s information to other contexts</u>.</p>  
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Argument-based passages.</b> Each of these passages has <b>a single associated question</b>. An argument-based passage will always be <b>one paragraph</b> (and sometimes as short as a sentence) and will always have one associated  multiple-choice question. You can expect to see <b>four to six argument-based passages</b> on your test.</p>
              <p>For argument-based passages, the questions concern the logic and structure of an argument. Typical questions will ask you <u>to find an assumption in the argument</u>, <u>to find ways to strengthen or weaken the argument</u>, and <u>to identify the logical structure of the passage</u>.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Information-based passages</h5>
          <p>Focus on how to be an <b>efficient, active reader</b>. Ask yourself <b>big-picture</b> questions about the passage and identifying concrete, <b>textual</b> evidence in support of your answers. Remember that <b>you should always read the passage first</b></p>

          <div>
            <p><b>Principle 1: Engage Yourself with the Text</b></p>
            <p>On GRE passages, you need to read <b>actively</b>, with an eye toward the passage’s <b>structure</b>. As you read through the passage, you should always be asking yourself questions. <b>What’s the author’s main point?</b> <b>Why is she telling me this?</b> <b>How does this detail relate to the passage’s overall purpose?</b></p>
  
            <p><b>Principle 2: Slow Down, Then Speed Up </b></p>
            <p>The beginning of a passage always introduces essential information. It will introduce key people or terms, important phenomena, the background for a theory, or in many cases, the <b>passage’s main point</b>. <b>Make sure that you understand all the terms and information introduced at the beginning of the passage.</b></p>
  
            <p><b>Principle 3: Identify the Main Purpose </b></p>
            <p>This means asking yourself: <b>“Why did the author write the passage?”</b> Many test-takers tend to answer this question by giving a list of what the author said, but this is not the answer that you’re looking for. <b>In one sentence, you should be able to say why the author wrote the passage.</b></p>
  
            <p>To identify a passage’s main idea, you should focus on <b>contrast signals</b> and <b>continuity signals</b>. When you see a contextual signal in a sentence. Usually, that sentence will either <b>determine the main purpose</b> of the passage or <b>provide a transition into the passage’s main purpose.</b> Generally, the author’s purpose will fall into four categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Explain.</b> The author’s goal is to <u>explain a concept or phenomenon</u>.</li>
              <li><b>Resolve/reconcile.</b> The author’s goal is to <b>resolve two or more competing viewpoints</b>.</li>
              <li><b>Introduce.</b> The author’s goal is to introduce a surprising discovery, phenomenon, or perspective</li>
              <li><b>Solve.</b> The author’s goal is to provide a solution or answer to a question presented in the passage.</li>
            </ul>
  
            <p><b>Principle 4: Understand the Role of Evidence </b></p>
            <p><b>Everything the author says will somehow relate to his main point.</b> Focus on the <b>first and last sentence of each paragraph</b>, and use those sentences to understand the <b>role the paragraph plays</b> in the overall passage. There are important contextual clues for the introduction of evidence: <b>For example</b>, <b>For instance</b>, <b>Indeed</b>, <b>Because of</b>, <b>As a result of</b>, <b>Since</b> <b>Illustrated by</b>, <b>Shown by</b>, <b>Evidence for</b></p>
  
            <p><b>Principle 5: Identify the Author’s Tone </b></p>
            <p><b>Tone</b> refers to the author’s attitude toward the subject matter in the passage. To identify tone, look for <b>valenced</b> words in the passage. If the author uses words like <b>fortunately</b> or thankfully, you know that the author feels <u>positively</u> about whatever he is discussing, whereas words like <b>regrettably</b> indicate that the author feels <u>negatively</u> about the content matter of the passage. Identifying tone is important not only because some questions explicitly ask about tone, but also because you can use the author’s tone to <b>eliminate wrong answer choices</b>. </p>
    
          </div>

          <div>
            <p><b>Main-Point Questions </b></p>
            <p>Main-point questions can be phrased as: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“The primary purpose of the passage is to . . .”</li>
              <li>“The author’s primary purpose is to . . .”</li>
              <li>“The author is primarily concerned with . . .”</li>
              <li>“Which of the following would be an appropriate title for the passage?”</li>
            </ul>
  
            <p>The answer to any <b>main-point</b> question will encompass the entire scope of the passage. Oftentimes, there will be choices that provide information that is true about the passage but that does not fully address the entire purpose of the passage. </p>
  
            <p><b>Detail Questions </b></p>
            <p>Detail questions can be phrased as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>“According to the passage . . .”</li>
              <li>“Based on the passage, which of the following is true . . .”</li>
              <li>“The author mentions which of the following . . .” </li>
            </ul>
  
            <p>To answer a detail question, you should focus on finding specific text from the passage that answers the question. For detail questions, you do not need to make any inferences and should avoid making assumptions. Instead, look at each choice, and identify which choice is best supported by concrete evidence from the passage. </p>
  
            <p><b>Inference Questions </b></p>
            <p>Inference questions can be phrased as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>“The passage suggests . . .”</li>
              <li>“The passage implies” . . .”</li>
              <li>“Which of the following can be inferred from the passage . . .”</li>
              <li>“Which of the following can be concluded from the passage . . .”</li>
            </ul>
  
            <p><b>Inference</b> questions are very similar to detail questions. As is the case with detail questions, with inference questions you should focus on identifying concrete textual evidence to justify your answer. The primary difference is the following: <b>To answer an inference question, you must draw a conclusion based on information in the passage</b>. With inference questions, the actual answer will <b>never be explicitly</b>stated in the passage. Instead, it will be <b>implied</b> by what the author says. To answer these questions, look for which choices can be directly inferred from the given information in the passage.</p>
  
            <p><b>Select-in-Passage Questions </b></p>
            <p>In Select-in-Passage questions, you will be asked to highlight a sentence in the passage that corresponds to the information that the question asks for. These questions will usually be phrased as “<b>Select the sentence in which the author</b> . . .”</p>
          </div>
          
          <h5>Argument-based passages</h5>
          <p>The passage will present information and a claim drawn from that information. Your task will be to identify information that most impacts the argument by strengthening it, weakening it, providing an assumption, or resolving an apparent discrepancy.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>First, identify the argument. The <b>argument</b> is an opinion drawn in the passage based on certain evidence. The evidence used to support the opinion is called the <b>premise</b> or premises, and the opinion the author draws is called the <b>claim</b>. <b>argument = premise + claim</b></p>
              <p>To identify the claim of the passage, look for words such as: <b>as a result</b>, <b>belief</b>, <b>consequently</b>, <b>hypothesis</b>, <b>in conclusion</b>, <b>may</b>, <b>might</b>, <b>nevertheless</b>, <b>nonetheless</b>, <b>predicts</b>, <b>probably</b>, <b>therefore</b>, <b>thus</b>, <b>will</b>. These are good claim signals because such words generally <b>introduce a belief that can be disputed</b>. If something in the passage can be disputed, then it is a claim, not a fact. To identify the premises of the passage, look for words such as:<b>since</b>, <b>because</b>, <b>due to</b>, <b>owing to</b>, <b>as a result of</b>. All of these phrases play the role of providing evidence that leads to a conclusion. Thus when you see these phrases, you should be on the lookout for the author’s main claim.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Once you have identified the claim and premises of the passage, your next step is to think about assumptions made in the argument. You can think of an <b>assumption</b> as the glue that holds the premises and claim together. Basically, it is a piece of evidence that is <b>necessary</b> for the conclusion to logically follow from the premises.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Finally, go through the choices. When going through the choices, your goal is to identify the choice that best addresses the link between the premises and the claim:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>In a <b>strengthen</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that strengthens the link.</li>
                <li>In a <b>weaken</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that breaks the link between premise and conclusion.</li>
                <li>In an <b>assumption</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that is necessary for the conclusion to be drawn from the premises.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
