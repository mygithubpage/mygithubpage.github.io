          <h4>Text Completion</h4>
          <p>Your task is to use the <b>context</b> of the sentence to select the choice that best fits in the blank.  The best method is to <b>predict the answer</b> and then see which choice matches your prediction by identifying the <b>contextual clues</b>. Contextual clues are words or phrases that link elements of a sentence. These clues help provide a logical structure for understanding the relationship between the sentence’s different components.</p>

          <p>Contextual clues will typically fall into three categories: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast signals:</b> but, yet, nonetheless, nevertheless, despite, in spite of, in contrast, contrasted with, opposed to, although, however, on the contrary, rather than, still, though</li>
            <li><b>Continuity signals:</b> indeed, and, also, moreover, furthermore, in addition, in fact, semicolon (;), colon (:)</li>
            <li><b>Cause-effect signals:</b> thus, therefore, consequently, due to, because, since, as a result, hence, so</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Let’s look at the steps for answering a typical Text Completion question.</p>
          <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Contextual Clue</b></p>
          <p><b>Step 2: Determine the Contextual Clue’s Relationship with the Rest of the Sentence</b></p>
          <p><b>Step 3: Predict Your Own Word for the Blank From Step 2</b></p>
          <p><b>Step 4: Select the Answer That Best Matches Your Prediction</b></p>

        <section>
          <h4>Sentence Equivalence</h4>
          <p>However, one key difference between the two question types is the fact that you must select <b>two</b> words for the blank in Sentence Equivalence questions. Though it might appear that this format makes Sentence Equivalence questions more difficult, you can take advantage of this fact by recognizing that <b>the correct answers will almost always be synonyms</b>. </p>

          <h4>Reading Comprehension</h4>
          <p>Of the 20 questions that you will see in each scored Verbal section, approximately 9 will be Reading Comprehension questions.  Reading Comprehension questions can be divided into two categories:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>Information-based passages.</b> These passages can be classified as “long” or “short.” A <b>long</b> passage is generally <b>three to four paragraphs</b> and 500+ words. Each long passage will have <b>four associated questions</b>. You can expect to see <b>one long passage</b> on your test. A <b>short</b> passage is generally <b>one to two paragraphs</b> and 100 to 300 words. Each short passage will have <b>one to four associated questions</b>, though most of the time there will be two or three questions. You can expect to see <b>five to six short passages</b> on your test. </p>
              <p>For both long and short passages, the questions concern <u>the meaning of the passage</u>, <u>the author’s purpose</u>, <u>details about the passage</u>, <u>inferences that can be drawn from the passage</u>, and <u>application of the passage’s information to other contexts</u>.</p>  
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Argument-based passages.</b> Each of these passages has <b>a single associated question</b>. An argument-based passage will always be <b>one paragraph</b> (and sometimes as short as a sentence) and will always have one associated  multiple-choice question. You can expect to see <b>four to six argument-based passages</b> on your test.</p>
              <p>For argument-based passages, the questions concern the logic and structure of an argument. Typical questions will ask you <u>to find an assumption in the argument</u>, <u>to find ways to strengthen or weaken the argument</u>, and <u>to identify the logical structure of the passage</u>.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Information-based passages</h5>
          <p>Focus on how to be an <b>efficient, active reader</b>. Ask yourself <b>big-picture</b> questions about the passage and identifying concrete, <b>textual</b> evidence in support of your answers. Remember that <b>you should always read the passage first</b></p>

          <div>
            <p><b>Principle 1: Engage Yourself with the Text</b></p>
            <p>On GRE passages, you need to read <b>actively</b>, with an eye toward the passage’s <b>structure</b>. As you read through the passage, you should always be asking yourself questions. <b>What’s the author’s main point?</b> <b>Why is she telling me this?</b> <b>How does this detail relate to the passage’s overall purpose?</b></p>
  
            <p><b>Principle 2: Slow Down, Then Speed Up </b></p>
            <p>The beginning of a passage always introduces essential information. It will introduce key people or terms, important phenomena, the background for a theory, or in many cases, the <b>passage’s main point</b>. <b>Make sure that you understand all the terms and information introduced at the beginning of the passage.</b></p>
  
            <p><b>Principle 3: Identify the Main Purpose </b></p>
            <p>This means asking yourself: <b>“Why did the author write the passage?”</b> Many test-takers tend to answer this question by giving a list of what the author said, but this is not the answer that you’re looking for. <b>In one sentence, you should be able to say why the author wrote the passage.</b></p>
  
            <p>To identify a passage’s main idea, you should focus on <b>contrast signals</b> and <b>continuity signals</b>. When you see a contextual signal in a sentence. Usually, that sentence will either <b>determine the main purpose</b> of the passage or <b>provide a transition into the passage’s main purpose.</b> Generally, the author’s purpose will fall into four categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Explain.</b> The author’s goal is to <u>explain a concept or phenomenon</u>.</li>
              <li><b>Resolve/reconcile.</b> The author’s goal is to <b>resolve two or more competing viewpoints</b>.</li>
              <li><b>Introduce.</b> The author’s goal is to introduce a surprising discovery, phenomenon, or perspective</li>
              <li><b>Solve.</b> The author’s goal is to provide a solution or answer to a question presented in the passage.</li>
            </ul>
  
            <p><b>Principle 4: Understand the Role of Evidence </b></p>
            <p><b>Everything the author says will somehow relate to his main point.</b> Focus on the <b>first and last sentence of each paragraph</b>, and use those sentences to understand the <b>role the paragraph plays</b> in the overall passage. There are important contextual clues for the introduction of evidence: <b>For example</b>, <b>For instance</b>, <b>Indeed</b>, <b>Because of</b>, <b>As a result of</b>, <b>Since</b> <b>Illustrated by</b>, <b>Shown by</b>, <b>Evidence for</b></p>
  
            <p><b>Principle 5: Identify the Author’s Tone </b></p>
            <p><b>Tone</b> refers to the author’s attitude toward the subject matter in the passage. To identify tone, look for <b>valenced</b> words in the passage. If the author uses words like <b>fortunately</b> or thankfully, you know that the author feels <u>positively</u> about whatever he is discussing, whereas words like <b>regrettably</b> indicate that the author feels <u>negatively</u> about the content matter of the passage. Identifying tone is important not only because some questions explicitly ask about tone, but also because you can use the author’s tone to <b>eliminate wrong answer choices</b>. </p>
    
          </div>

          <div>
            <p><b>Main-Point Questions </b></p>
            <p>Main-point questions can be phrased as: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“The primary purpose of the passage is to . . .”</li>
              <li>“The author’s primary purpose is to . . .”</li>
              <li>“The author is primarily concerned with . . .”</li>
              <li>“Which of the following would be an appropriate title for the passage?”</li>
            </ul>
  
            <p>The answer to any <b>main-point</b> question will encompass the entire scope of the passage. Oftentimes, there will be choices that provide information that is true about the passage but that does not fully address the entire purpose of the passage. </p>
  
            <p><b>Detail Questions </b></p>
            <p>Detail questions can be phrased as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>“According to the passage . . .”</li>
              <li>“Based on the passage, which of the following is true . . .”</li>
              <li>“The author mentions which of the following . . .” </li>
            </ul>
  
            <p>To answer a detail question, you should focus on finding specific text from the passage that answers the question. For detail questions, you do not need to make any inferences and should avoid making assumptions. Instead, look at each choice, and identify which choice is best supported by concrete evidence from the passage. </p>
  
            <p><b>Inference Questions </b></p>
            <p>Inference questions can be phrased as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>“The passage suggests . . .”</li>
              <li>“The passage implies” . . .”</li>
              <li>“Which of the following can be inferred from the passage . . .”</li>
              <li>“Which of the following can be concluded from the passage . . .”</li>
            </ul>
  
            <p><b>Inference</b> questions are very similar to detail questions. As is the case with detail questions, with inference questions you should focus on identifying concrete textual evidence to justify your answer. The primary difference is the following: <b>To answer an inference question, you must draw a conclusion based on information in the passage</b>. With inference questions, the actual answer will <b>never be explicitly</b>stated in the passage. Instead, it will be <b>implied</b> by what the author says. To answer these questions, look for which choices can be directly inferred from the given information in the passage.</p>
  
            <p><b>Select-in-Passage Questions </b></p>
            <p>In Select-in-Passage questions, you will be asked to highlight a sentence in the passage that corresponds to the information that the question asks for. These questions will usually be phrased as “<b>Select the sentence in which the author</b> . . .”</p>
          </div>
          
          <h5>Argument-based passages</h5>
          <p>The passage will present information and a claim drawn from that information. Your task will be to identify information that most impacts the argument by strengthening it, weakening it, providing an assumption, or resolving an apparent discrepancy.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>First, identify the argument. The <b>argument</b> is an opinion drawn in the passage based on certain evidence. The evidence used to support the opinion is called the <b>premise</b> or premises, and the opinion the author draws is called the <b>claim</b>. <b>argument = premise + claim</b></p>
              <p>To identify the claim of the passage, look for words such as: <b>as a result</b>, <b>belief</b>, <b>consequently</b>, <b>hypothesis</b>, <b>in conclusion</b>, <b>may</b>, <b>might</b>, <b>nevertheless</b>, <b>nonetheless</b>, <b>predicts</b>, <b>probably</b>, <b>therefore</b>, <b>thus</b>, <b>will</b>. These are good claim signals because such words generally <b>introduce a belief that can be disputed</b>. If something in the passage can be disputed, then it is a claim, not a fact. To identify the premises of the passage, look for words such as:<b>since</b>, <b>because</b>, <b>due to</b>, <b>owing to</b>, <b>as a result of</b>. All of these phrases play the role of providing evidence that leads to a conclusion. Thus when you see these phrases, you should be on the lookout for the author’s main claim.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Once you have identified the claim and premises of the passage, your next step is to think about assumptions made in the argument. You can think of an <b>assumption</b> as the glue that holds the premises and claim together. Basically, it is a piece of evidence that is <b>necessary</b> for the conclusion to logically follow from the premises.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Finally, go through the choices. When going through the choices, your goal is to identify the choice that best addresses the link between the premises and the claim:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>In a <b>strengthen</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that strengthens the link.</li>
                <li>In a <b>weaken</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that breaks the link between premise and conclusion.</li>
                <li>In an <b>assumption</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that is necessary for the conclusion to be drawn from the premises.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

            <h4>Text Completion</h4>

            <h5>STEP 1 Read the sentence, looking for clues.</h5>
            <p>A road sign is a structural key word that signals a connection between ideas; it also determines the direction of the relationship.</p>

            <p>“Straight-ahead” road signs are used to make one part of the sentence <b>support</b> or elaborate upon another part. They continue the sentence in the <b>same</b> direction. The positive or negative connotation of what follows is not changed by these clues. The following are the example of this kind of sign: <b>And</b>, <b>Since</b>, <b>Also</b>, <b>Thus</b>, <b>Because</b>, <b>; (semicolon)</b>, <b>Likewise</b>, <b>Moreover</b>, <b>Similarly</b>, <b>In addition</b>, <b>Consequently</b></p>
            
            <p>“Detour” road signs change the direction of the sentence. They make one part of the sentence <b>contradict</b> or qualify another part. They continue the sentence in <b>different</b> direction. The positive or negative connotation of an answer is changed by these clues. The following are the examples of this kind of sign: <b>But</b>, <b>Despite</b>, <b>Yet</b>, <b>However</b>, <b>Unless</b>, <b>Rather</b>, <b>Although</b>, <b>While</b>, <b>On the other hand</b>, <b>Unfortunately</b>, <b>Nonetheless</b>, <b>Conversely</b></p>

            <h5>STEP 2 Predict an answer.</h5>
            <p>Once you’ve found the road sign and the key word(s) relevant to the blank, predict an answer for the blank. Your prediction just needs to be a paraphrase that logically fits into the sentence. By predicting, you avoid the temptation of trying every answer choice on its own.</p>

            <h5>STEP 3 Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction. </h5>

            <h4>Reading Comprehension</h4>

            <h5>STEP 1 Read the passage strategically. </h5>
            <p>Noting the big-picture information means identifying the <b>topic</b>, <b>scope</b>, and <b>purpose</b> of a passage. The <u>topic</u> is what the passage is about, very broadly stated. The <u>scope</u> is that specific aspect of the topic that interests the author. The <u>purpose</u> is the author’s reason for writing the passage. </p>

            <p>The purpose of a passage include the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To <b>explain</b> an aspect of a topic</li>
              <li>To <b>describe</b> the features of a thing or event</li>
              <li>To <b>analyze</b> how something works</li>
              <li>To <b>compare and contrast</b> two or more things—the author may simply describe how they are similar and/or different, or the author may also express an opinion about which is better</li>
              <li>To critique or <b>evaluate</b> how well or poorly something achieves a purpose—the author may only present other people’s critiques or may offer her own opinion</li>
              <li>To <b>argue</b> for a position—the author has an opinion </li>
              <li>To <b>rebut</b> someone’s position—the author disagrees with someone else’s opinion</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Writing down the topic, scope, and purpose, as in the examples above, as well as the following information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Main idea of each paragraph</li>
              <li>Any opinion(s) offered—whose opinion and what it is</li>
              <li>Definition of any specialized term(s) central to the main idea</li>
              <li>Key examples—a few words identifying the example and what idea it illustrates</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here are the different types of key words that will help you locate central ideas and opinions and grasp the structure of the passage:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Emphasis</b> and <b>opinion</b> key words are used when the author wants to call attention to a specific point. These come in two varieties. Emphasis key words, such as <i>very</i> and <i>critical</i>, point to ideas that are important to the author. Opinion key words, such as <i>beneficial</i> or <i>dead end</i>, emphasize a positive or negative charge and point to attitudes toward or judgments about ideas. These opinions are frequently the focus of GRE questions. Be sure to distinguish between the author’s opinions and those of others.</li>
              <li><b>Contrast</b> key words such as <i>but</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>, and <i>on the other hand</i> tell you that a change or disagreement is coming.</li>
              <li><b>Continuation</b> key words such as <i>moreover</i>, <i>furthermore</i>, <i>also</i>, and <i>in addition</i> tell you to expect more of the same line of reasoning.</li>
              <li><b>Logic</b> key words, which play an important role in answering Reasoning questions, alert you to an argument. <b>Conclusion</b> key words such as <i>therefore</i> and <i>thus</i> indicate a supported claim or main point. <b>Evidence</b> key words like <i>because</i>, <i>since</i>, and <i>for</i> announce the reasons used to support that conclusion. Again, be careful to distinguish between an argument the author is making and someone else’s argument, which the author may be explaining without taking a position, agreeing with, or rebutting.</li>
              <li><b>Illustration</b> key words let you know that what follows is an example of a broader point. One example, of course, is <i>example</i>. <i>For instance</i> is another favorite in GRE passages.</li>
              <li><b>Sequence/Grouping</b> key words delineate how events or characteristics are related. <i>First, second,</i> and <i>third</i> are examples, as is a sequence like <i>17th century</i>, <i>18th century</i>, and <i>today</i>. Science passages may group complicated phenomena using simpler key words (<i>at a higher temperature</i> and <i>at a lower temperature</i>, for example). Look for these key words especially in passages explaining steps in a scientific, social, or artistic process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>STEP 2 Analyze the question stem.</h5>
            <p>The questions that accompany a passage almost always fall into one of just a handful of categories</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Global</b>. These ask about the passage as a whole. Look for language in the question stem that asks you to determine a passage’s <b>main idea</b>, <b>primary purpose</b>, or overall structure. Here are some examples of Global question stems:
                <ul>
                    <li>Which of the following most accurately describes the <b>primary purpose</b> of the passage?</li>
                    <li>The <b>author’s tone</b> could best be described as</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Detail</b>. These ask you to research the text and identify a specific detail mentioned in the passage. Look for language in the question stem such as “<b>according to</b> the author” or “is <b>mentioned</b> in the passage.” Here are some examples of Detail question stems:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>According</b> the passage, the primary cause of unemployment in micronations is a lack of</li>
                    <li>Which of the following was <b>mentioned</b> in the passage as a result of high employment?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Inference</b>. These questions ask for something that, though not stated explicitly in the text, must be true based on the information that is provide in the passage. Look for language in the question stem like “suggests,” “implies,” or “<b>most likely</b> agrees.” Here are some examples of Inference question stems:
                <ul>
                    <li>The passage most strongly <b>suggests</b> that which of the following is true?</li>
                    <li>With which of the following characterizations of medieval comedies would the author <b>most likely</b> agree?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Logic</b>. This type of question asks you to describe why the author included a certain word, phrase, or statement. Look for language like “in order to” or “primarily serves to.” Here are some examples of Logic question stems:
                <ul>
                    <li>The author mentions Tussey’s theory of copyright systems primarily <b>in order to</b></li>
                    <li>Which of the following most accurately describes <b>the reason the author</b> included the results of the experiments in lines 9–12?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Vocab-in-Context</b>. These relatively straightforward questions ask you to identify the specific way a word is used in the passage. Here are some examples of Vocab-in-Context questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>As it is used in line 16, “brilliant” most nearly means</li>
                    <li>>Which of the following most closely corresponds to the meaning of the word “effect” as it is used in line 26?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Reasoning</b>. These questions ask you to analyze an author’s reasoning in an argument. They may ask you to identify an argument’s assumption, point out a flaw in the author’s reasoning, or strengthen or weaken the reasoning. Here are some examples of Reasoning questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>The ethicist’s argument requires the assumption that</li>
                    <li>Which of the following would cast the most doubt on the conclusion drawn by the scholar?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>STEP 3 Research the relevant text in the passage. </h5>
            <p><b>Global</b> questions and some <b>Inference</b> and <b>Logic</b> questions are so general that you can simply use your understanding of the passage’s topic, <b>scope</b>, and <b>purpose</b> as well as the structure of the passage to answer them.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Global.</b> Attack Global questions by using the topic, scope, and purpose you noted as you read the passage. <i>Eliminate</i> answers that reflect only a part of the passage or supporting ideas rather than the main idea.</li>
              <li><b>Detail.</b> You will have to use your knowledge of the passage or your passage map to research the relevant part of the passage. <i>Eliminate</i> answer choices that distort what the author actually said about the matter at issue or that provide a correct detail about something else.</li>
              <li><b>Inference.</b> For Inference questions that give specific research clues, consult the specific part of the passage referenced in the question. Focus on key words that surround the relevant text in the passage. When evaluating answer choices for Inference questions, <i>eliminate</i> choices that reflect the author’s (or someone else’s) opinion but are worded too strongly (are Extreme) and those that are reasonable statements but wander beyond the scope of the passage (Outside the Scope).</li>
              <li><b>Logic.</b> Logic questions often contain line references or quote specific text from the passage. Consult your passage map for the author’s overall purpose and for notes you’ve made about the specific part of the passage the referenced quote or phrase is from. Then go to the passage and read before and after the referenced text. Your task for these questions is to understand why the author included something in the passage, so consider how the passage would be affected if the reference text were not there. What function does it serve in the larger context of the passage? <i>Eliminate</i> choices that do not align with the author’s purpose in writing.</li>
              <li><b>Vocab-in-Context.</b> These questions are relatively straightforward, and researching is often simply a matter of finding the word in question in the passage, then considering how that word is used in context. The words asked about will have more than one meaning, usually a common one, and one or more uncommon ones, and often the author has used the word for a less common meaning. Ask: What word could one use to replace the word referenced in the question? Use that prediction as you evaluate the answer choices.</li>
              <li><b>Reasoning.</b> In Reasoning questions, you will most often be asked to analyze an argument, so your first task should be to identify the argument’s conclusion and its evidence. The conclusion of an argument is simply the <b>claim</b> that the author is trying to convince you of; the <b>evidence</b>, then, is the information used to support that conclusion. Once you’ve separated an author’s claim from her evidence for that claim, your task is to identify the author’s assumption. The <b>assumption</b> in an argument is any unstated fact that must be true in order for the argument to make sense. Reasoning questions come in a variety of forms. A question might ask you to simply find an assumption of an argument, while another might ask you to identify a reasoning flaw. Some Reasoning questions will have you strengthen or weaken an argument, while others test your ability to resolve a paradox. See the section “How to Approach Reasoning Questions” toward the end of this chapter for examples of different types of Reasoning questions and predictable patterns to look for.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>STEP 4 Make a prediction.</h5>
            <p>Instead, use the information in the passage to arrive at a correct answer. After you have read the passage, identified the type of question you’re dealing with, and researched as appropriate, take a few seconds to imagine what the correct answer should look like. This is your prediction. Then, when you begin to read the answers, you will be able to rule out those that do not match your prediction—that do not match information in the passage—even if they seem like reasonable or relevant statements.</p>

            <h5>STEP 5 Evaluate the answer choices. </h5>
            <p>There are also predictable and repeatable types of wrong answers. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Outside the Scope.</b> These answer choices misrepresent the scope of a particular part of the passage, often by drawing an irrelevant comparison to something not mentioned in the passage.</li>
              <li><b>Extreme.</b> Be careful when you see answer choices that include extreme language like <i>always, never, mostly, rarely,</i> and so on. The passage must support such strong/extreme language for the choice to be correct.</li>
              <li><b>Distortion.</b> These incorrect answer choices use specific language from the passage, but then distort the context or meaning of the details in the passage.</li>
              <li><b>180.</b> These answer choices contradict (either subtly or explicitly) the statements made in the passage.</li>
              <li><b>Half-Right/Half-Wrong.</b> These are especially common in longer answer choices, where the first clause of a long sentence is correct but then the second half goes awry.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A <b>conclusion</b> is often an opinion, a bold claim, a recommendation, a prediction, or the rebuttal of someone else’s viewpoint. <b>Evidence</b> is the facts and/or opinions presented in support of the author’s claim. <b>Assumption</b> is, the fact that the author believes must be true but hasn’t explicitly stated. If you’re having trouble spotting it, ask yourself this: Is there any new term or idea that appears in the conclusion but was nowhere to be found in the evidence? </p>
            <p>Arguments like the one in which the author moves from discussing one thing in the evidence to a different thing in the conclusion—are called <b>scope shift arguments</b>. <b>Representativeness Arguments</b> is aother common argument pattern in which the conclusion is about a different population than the evidence. lookout for any argument in which information about one group is used to draw a conclusion about a larger group or a different group. If you are asked to weaken the argument, look for an answer that indicates the group in the evidence <u>differs on a key characteristic</u> from the group in the conclusion. If you are asked to strengthen the argument, look for a statement that says the two groups are <u>similar in an important way</u>. </p>
