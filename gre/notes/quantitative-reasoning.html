        <h3>Quantitative Comparison Questions</h3>

        <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Become familiar with the answer choices.</b> Quantitative Comparison questions always have the same answer choices, so get to know them, especially the last choice, “The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.” Never select this last choice if it is clear that the values of the two quantities can be determined by computation. Also, if you determine that one quantity is greater than the other, make sure you carefully select the corresponding choice so as not to reverse the ﬁrst two choices.</li>
            <li><b>Avoid unnecessary computations.</b> Don’t waste time performing needless computations in order to compare the two quantities. Simplify, transform, or estimate one or both of the given quantities only as much as is necessary to compare them.</li>
            <li><b>Remember that geometric ﬁgures are not necessarily drawn to scale.</b> If any aspect of a given geometric ﬁgure is not fully determined, try to redraw the ﬁgure, keeping those aspects that are completely determined by the given information ﬁxed but changing the aspects of the ﬁgure that are not determined. Examine the results. What variations are possible in the relative lengths of line segments or measures of angles?</li>
            <li><b>Plug in numbers.</b> If one or both of the quantities are algebraic expressions, you can substitute easy numbers for the variables and compare the resulting quantities in your analysis. Consider all kinds of appropriate numbers before you give an answer: e.g., zero, positive and negative numbers, small and large numbers, fractions and decimals. If you see that Quantity A is greater than Quantity B in one case and Quantity B is greater than Quantity A in another case, choose “The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.”</li>
            <li><b>Simplify the comparison.</b> If both quantities are algebraic or arithmetic expressions and you cannot easily see a relationship between them, you can try to simplify the comparison. Try a step-by-step simpliﬁcation that is similar to the steps involved when you solve the equation for <span class="my-math">`x`</span>, or similar to the <span class="my-math">`5 = 4x + 3`</span> steps involved when you determine that the inequality is equivalent <span class="my-math">`(3y+2)/5 \lt y`</span> to the simpler inequality Begin by setting up a comparison involving the <span class="my-math">`1 \lt y`</span>. two quantities, as follows:
            <p class="w3-center">QuantityA &#9072; QuantityB</p>
            &#9072; where is a “placeholder” that could represent the relationship greater than &#9072; (&gt;), less than (&lt;), or equal to (=) or could represent the fact that the relationship cannot be determined from the information given. Then try to simplify the comparison, step by step, until you can determine a relationship between simpliﬁed quantities. For example, you may conclude after the last step that represents equal to (=). Based on this conclusion, you may be able to &#9072; compare Quantities A and B. To understand this strategy more fully, see sample questions 6 to 9.</li>

        <h3>Select One Answer Questions</h3>

        <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Use the fact that the answer is there.</b> If your answer is not one of the ﬁve answer choices given, you should assume that your answer is incorrect and do the following:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Reread the question carefully—you may have missed an important detail or misinterpreted some information.</li>
              <li>Check your computations—you may have made a mistake, such as mis-keying a number on the calculator.</li>
              <li>Reevaluate your solution method—you may have a ﬂaw in your reasoning.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Examine the answer choices.</b> In some questions you are asked explicitly which of the choices has a certain property. You may have to consider each choice separately, or you may be able to see a relationship between the choices that will help you ﬁnd the answer more quickly. In other questions, it may be helpful to work backward from the choices, say, by substituting the choices in an equation or inequality to see which one works. However, be careful, as that method may take more time than using reasoning.</li>
            <li><b>For questions that require approximations, scan the answer choices to see how close an approximation is needed.</b> In other questions, too, it may be helpful to scan the choices brieﬂy before solving the problem to get a better sense of what the question is asking. If computations are involved in the solution, it may be necessary to carry out all computations exactly and round only your ﬁnal answer in order to get the required degree of accuracy. In other questions, you may ﬁnd that estimation is sufﬁcient and will help you avoid spending time on long computations.</li>

        <h3>Select One or More Answer Questions</h3>

        <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Note whether you are asked to indicate a speciﬁc number of answer choices or all choices that apply.</b> In the latter case, be sure to consider all of the choices, determine which ones are correct, and select all of those and only those choices. Note that there may be only one correct choice.</li>
            <li><b>In some questions that involve conditions that limit the possible values of numerical answer choices, it may be efﬁcient to determine the least and/or the greatest possible value.</b> Knowing the least and/or greatest possible value may enable you to quickly determine all of the choices that are correct.</li>

        <h3>Numeric Entry Questions</h3>

        <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Make sure you answer the question that is asked.</b> Since there are no answer choices to guide you, read the question carefully and make sure you provide the type of answer required. Sometimes there will be labels before or after the answer box to indicate the appropriate type of answer. Pay special attention to units such as feet or miles, to orders of magnitude such as millions or billions, and to percents as compared with decimals.</li>
            <li><b>If you are asked to round your answer, make sure you round to the required degree of accuracy.</b> For example, if an answer of 46.7 is to be rounded to the nearest integer, you need to enter the number 47. If your solution strategy involves intermediate computations, you should carry out all computations exactly and round only your ﬁnal answer in order to get the required degree of accuracy. If no rounding instructions are given, enter the exact answer.</li>
            <li><b>Examine your answer to see if it is reasonable with respect to the information given.</b> You may want to use estimation or another solution path to double-check your answer.</li>

        <h3>Data Interpretation Sets</h3>

        <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Scan the data presentation brieﬂy to see what it is about, but do not spend time studying all of the information in detail.</b> Focus on those aspects of the data that are necessary to answer the questions. Pay attention to the axes and scales of graphs; to the units of measurement or orders of magnitude (such as billions) that are given in the titles, labels, and legends; and to any notes that clarify the data.</li>
            <li><b>Bar graphs and circle graphs, as well as other graphical displays of data, are drawn to scale, so you can read or estimate data visually from such graphs.</b> For example, you can use the relative sizes of bars or sectors to compare the quantities that they represent, but be aware of broken scales and of bars that do not start at 0.</li>
            <li><b>The questions are to be answered only on the basis of the data presented, everyday facts (such as the number of days in a year), and your knowledge of mathematics.</b> Do not make use of specialized information you may recall from other sources about the particular context on which the questions are based unless the information can be derived from the data presented.</li>
