          <h4>How to Approach the "Analyze an Issue" Task</h4>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1: Brainstorm (3 Minutes)</b>
          </p>
          <p>Once you read the task, you should spend time determining what stance you will take on the issue and what evidence you will use to support that stance.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 2: Create Your Outline (3 Minutes)</b>
          </p>
          <p>A good issue essay should consist of (1) an introductory paragraph that states your main point, (2) body paragraphs providing examples that reinforce this main point, and (3) a concluding paragraph that summarizes your point and its implications.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 3: Write Your Body Paragraphs (5 Minutes per Paragraph)</b>
          </p>
          <p>Start with your body paragraphs because these constitute the most important part of your essay. Each body paragraph should take the following structure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sentence 1: Topic sentence: State the point that you are trying to convey in the paragraph.</li>
            <li>Sentences 2 to 4: Example: Go into detail with the example that you are using to support your main point.</li>
            <li>Sentences 5 to 6. Reasoning: Explain how your example supports the topic sentence.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <b>Step 4: Write Your Introductory and Concluding Paragraphs (6 Minutes) </b>
          </p>
          <p>The goal of your introductory paragraph is twofold:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Give context for the issue you are discussing.</li>
            <li>Clearly state your thesis—the stance that you will be trying to support in the essay.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>To give context, you should first explain the larger relevance of the issue. To do so, it is oftentimes helpful to address the counterargument, a rhetorical strategy in which you provide the opposite side of the argument and then segue into your own opinion. </p>
          <p>The goal of your concluding paragraph is to summarize the points you made in your essay and to discuss the implications of your main point. When discussing the implications, you should focus on addressing the relevance of your thesis to issues outside the scope of the essay.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 5: Proofread (3 Minutes) </b>
          </p>
          <p>When proofreading, you should reread the essay carefully, focusing on any grammatical mistakes or typos you may have made. So worry less about the content and more about the technical aspects of your writing—the grammar, spelling, and fluidity of the sentences.</p>

          <h4>How to Approach the "Analyze an Argument" Task</h4>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1: Read the Argument and Identify the Claim and Evidence (2 Minutes)</b>
          </p>
          <p>When reading the argument, your goal is to identify the main conclusion the author draws and the evidence that he or she uses to support this conclusion.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 2: Identify the Major Assumptions and Create Your Outline (3 Minutes)</b>
          </p>
          <p> An assumption is an unstated piece of information that must be true for an argument to be valid. </p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 3: Write Your Body Paragraphs (5 Minutes per Paragraph)</b>
          </p>
          <p>In each body paragraph, you should examine a major assumption in the argument. Start by introducing the assumption. Then state why the argument actually depends on this assumption.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 4: Write Your Introduction and Conclusion (7 Minutes) </b>
          </p>
          <p>In the introduction, focus on restating the author’s main point, and briefly summarize why you think the argument is flawed. Make it obvious that there are important assumptions and flaws in the argument.</p>
          <p>Your conclusion does not need to include a restatement of the assumptions listed in your argument. Simply write a paragraph showing that you understand the author’s perspective but find it lacking.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 5: Proofread (3 Minutes) </b>
          </p>
          <p>When proofreading, you should reread the essay carefully, focusing on any grammatical mistakes or typos you may have made. So worry less about the content and more about the technical aspects of your writing—the grammar, spelling, and fluidity of the sentences.</p>

          <p>You should be familiar with the directions for the Argument task and with certain key concepts, including the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>alternative explanation</b>: a possible competing version of what might have caused the events in question; an alternative explanation undercuts or qualifies the original explanation because it too can account for the observed facts</li>
            <li>
              <b>analysis</b>: the process of breaking something (e.g., an argument) down into its component parts in order to understand how they work together to make up the whole</li>
            <li>
              <b>argument</b>: a claim or a set of claims with reasons and evidence offered as support; a line of reasoning meant to demonstrate the truth or falsehood of something</li>
            <li>
              <b>assumption</b>: a belief, often unstated or unexamined, that someone must hold in order to maintain a particular position; something that is taken for granted but that must be true in order for the conclusion to be true</li>
            <li>
              <b>conclusion</b>: the end point reached by a line of reasoning, valid if the reasoning is sound; the resulting assertion</li>
            <li>
              <b>counterexample</b>: an example, real or hypothetical, that refutes or disproves a statement in the argument</li>
            <li>
              <b>evaluation</b>: an assessment of the quality of evidence and reasons in an argument and of the overall merit of an argument</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No matter which approach you take, you should</p>
          <ul>
            <li>carefully read the
              <b>argument</b> and the specific instructions — you might want to read them over more than once</li>
            <li>identify as many of the
              <b>argument</b>’s claims,
              <b>conclusions</b>, and underlying
              <b>assumptions</b> as possible and evaluate their quality</li>
            <li>think of as many
              <b>alternative explanations</b> and
              <b>counterexamples</b> as you can</li>
            <li>think of what specific additional evidence might weaken or lend support to the claims</li>
            <li>ask yourself what changes in the argument would make the reasoning more sound</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Writing
              <b>Correctly</b>

          <section>
            <h5>Avoiding Sentence Fragments and Run-Ons</h5>
            <p>Every sentence in formal expository writing must have an
              <b>independent clause</b>: a clause that contains a subject and a predicate. A
              <b>sentence fragment</b> has no independent clause; a
              <b>run-on sentence</b> has two or more independent clauses that are improperly connected.</p>
            <p>Beginning sentences with
              <b>coordinating conjunctions</b>—
              <b>for, and, nor, but, or, yet</b>, and
              <b>so</b>—is acceptable in moderation and is sometimes an effective stylistic choice to emphasize an idea. Nonetheless, check whether joining sentences with the conjunction or using an adverb, such as
              <b>moreover</b> or
              <b>however</b>, would be more effective.</p>

                  <b>Additional paragraphs, as time permits:</b> If you have time and have more strong points to make, you may write additional paragraphs in which you state and elaborate upon other points in support of your position.

Another option is to raise and rebut counterarguments with your own arguments in each body paragraph, instead of devoting a paragraph to this purpose; just make sure your essay acknowledges at least one argument someone on the other side would make.

              <p>You shouldn’t proceed with this step until you’ve completed the three preceding ones. You’ll save time and energy by preparing your essay before you start typing it. Graders have a limited amount of time in which to read your essay, so start and conclude with strong statements. Be forceful and concise with your prose and link related ideas with transition words and phrases. When you write crisply and give clear indicators of how one idea connects to the next, you will make your writing flow and make the grader's job easier.</p>

          <h4>The Argument Essay</h4>
          <p>Look carefully for unstated
            <b>assumptions</b> the writer makes in order to move from <b>evidence</b> to <b>conclusion</b>.</p>

                Take the argument apart.</span>
              <p>The first step in analyzing an argument is to identify the conclusion. After you’ve nailed down the conclusion, your next step is to characterize the evidence used to support it. </p>

                Select the points you will make.</span>
              <p>Now that you clearly understand the argument, proceed to analyze it. You might do this by directly identifying the assumptions, by determining what type of evidence would fill in the gaps, or discussing whether the possibilities the author has overlooked could be better accounted for by another argument.  Note, too, any terms that are ambiguous and would need definition for the argument to be clear. Finally, think of additional evidence that might be found that could strengthen or weaken the argument. Regardless of the variation in your approach, the argument will always be weak, and you will conclude your essay by saying that without additional evidence, the intended audience for the argument should be skeptical of its claim.</p>

                Organize, using Kaplan’s Argument essay template.</span>
              <p>If some of the potential flaws in the argument are closely related, consider discussing them both in the same body paragraph. You may find that you don't feel very confident discussing one or more of the points you jotted down—cross these out. Once any weak points are crossed out and related you don't just want to find fault with the argument. Make sure to discuss the evidence that, if the author included it, would make the argument more convincing. </p>

                <li>
                  <b>Paragraph 1:</b> Paraphrase the argument (the author’s conclusion and evidence). Summarize the goal of your essay, according to the specific instructions. State your thesis, which is that the argument is unconvincing.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Paragraph 2:</b> State and evaluate an important assumption the author makes, question to be answered, or possible alternative explanation (depending on the specific instructions).</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Paragraph 3:</b> State and evaluate another assumption the author makes, question to be answered, or possible alternative explanation.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Additional paragraphs, as time permits:</b> State and evaluate additional assumptions the author makes, questions to be answered, or possible alternative explanations. (Time valve #1: skip if need be.)</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Next-to-last paragraph:</b> Do not stop at pointing out the flaws in the author's reasoning. Show what evidence, if it were true, would strengthen the argument. Another option is to discuss this evidence in each body paragraph, instead of devoting a paragraph to this purpose; just make sure your essay includes consideration of how the argument could be improved. (Time valve #2: combine with conclusion if need be.)</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Last paragraph:</b> Conclude by summarizing your main points in a way that addresses the specific instructions. State that unless additional evidence is provided, the audience for the argument should find it unpersuasive.</li>

                Type your essay.</span>
              <p>You shouldn’t proceed with this step until you’ve completed the three preceding ones. Graders can give your essay a limited amount of time, so start and conclude with strong statements. Be forceful and concise with your prose and link related ideas with transition words and phrases. When you write crisply and give clear indicators of how one idea connects to the next, you will make your writing flow and earn a higher score.
