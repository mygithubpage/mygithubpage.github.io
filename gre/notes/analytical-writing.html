          <h3>How to Approach the "Analyze an Issue" Task</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1: Brainstorm (3 Minutes)</b>
          </p>
          <p>Once you read the task, you should spend time determining what stance you will take on the issue and what evidence you will use to support that stance.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 2: Create Your Outline (3 Minutes)</b>
          </p>
          <p>A good issue essay should consist of (1) an introductory paragraph that states your main point, (2) body paragraphs providing examples that reinforce this main point, and (3) a concluding paragraph that summarizes your point and its implications.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 3: Write Your Body Paragraphs (5 Minutes per Paragraph)</b>
          </p>
          <p>Start with your body paragraphs because these constitute the most important part of your essay. Each body paragraph should take the following structure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sentence 1: Topic sentence: State the point that you are trying to convey in the paragraph.</li>
            <li>Sentences 2 to 4: Example: Go into detail with the example that you are using to support your main point.</li>
            <li>Sentences 5 to 6. Reasoning: Explain how your example supports the topic sentence.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <b>Step 4: Write Your Introductory and Concluding Paragraphs (6 Minutes) </b>
          </p>
          <p>The goal of your introductory paragraph is twofold:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Give context for the issue you are discussing.</li>
            <li>Clearly state your thesis—the stance that you will be trying to support in the essay.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>To give context, you should first explain the larger relevance of the issue. To do so, it is oftentimes helpful to address the counterargument, a rhetorical strategy in which you provide the opposite side of the argument and then segue into your own opinion. </p>
          <p>The goal of your concluding paragraph is to summarize the points you made in your essay and to discuss the implications of your main point. When discussing the implications, you should focus on addressing the relevance of your thesis to issues outside the scope of the essay.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 5: Proofread (3 Minutes) </b>
          </p>
          <p>When proofreading, you should reread the essay carefully, focusing on any grammatical mistakes or typos you may have made. So worry less about the content and more about the technical aspects of your writing—the grammar, spelling, and fluidity of the sentences.</p>

          <h3>How to Approach the "Analyze an Argument" Task</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1: Read the Argument and Identify the Claim and Evidence (2 Minutes)</b>
          </p>
          <p>When reading the argument, your goal is to identify the main conclusion the author draws and the evidence that he or she uses to support this conclusion.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 2: Identify the Major Assumptions and Create Your Outline (3 Minutes)</b>
          </p>
          <p> An assumption is an unstated piece of information that must be true for an argument to be valid. </p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 3: Write Your Body Paragraphs (5 Minutes per Paragraph)</b>
          </p>
          <p>In each body paragraph, you should examine a major assumption in the argument. Start by introducing the assumption. Then state why the argument actually depends on this assumption.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 4: Write Your Introduction and Conclusion (7 Minutes) </b>
          </p>
          <p>In the introduction, focus on restating the author’s main point, and briefly summarize why you think the argument is flawed. Make it obvious that there are important assumptions and flaws in the argument.</p>
          <p>Your conclusion does not need to include a restatement of the assumptions listed in your argument. Simply write a paragraph showing that you understand the author’s perspective but find it lacking.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 5: Proofread (3 Minutes) </b>
          </p>
          <p>When proofreading, you should reread the essay carefully, focusing on any grammatical mistakes or typos you may have made. So worry less about the content and more about the technical aspects of your writing—the grammar, spelling, and fluidity of the sentences.</p>

          <p>You should be familiar with the directions for the Argument task and with certain key concepts, including the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>alternative explanation</b>: a possible competing version of what might have caused the events in question; an alternative explanation undercuts or qualifies the original explanation because it too can account for the observed facts</li>
            <li>
              <b>analysis</b>: the process of breaking something (e.g., an argument) down into its component parts in order to understand how they work together to make up the whole</li>
            <li>
              <b>argument</b>: a claim or a set of claims with reasons and evidence offered as support; a line of reasoning meant to demonstrate the truth or falsehood of something</li>
            <li>
              <b>assumption</b>: a belief, often unstated or unexamined, that someone must hold in order to maintain a particular position; something that is taken for granted but that must be true in order for the conclusion to be true</li>
            <li>
              <b>conclusion</b>: the end point reached by a line of reasoning, valid if the reasoning is sound; the resulting assertion</li>
            <li>
              <b>counterexample</b>: an example, real or hypothetical, that refutes or disproves a statement in the argument</li>
            <li>
              <b>evaluation</b>: an assessment of the quality of evidence and reasons in an argument and of the overall merit of an argument</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No matter which approach you take, you should</p>
          <ul>
            <li>carefully read the
              <b>argument</b> and the specific instructions — you might want to read them over more than once</li>
            <li>identify as many of the
              <b>argument</b>’s claims,
              <b>conclusions</b>, and underlying
              <b>assumptions</b> as possible and evaluate their quality</li>
            <li>think of as many
              <b>alternative explanations</b> and
              <b>counterexamples</b> as you can</li>
            <li>think of what specific additional evidence might weaken or lend support to the claims</li>
            <li>ask yourself what changes in the argument would make the reasoning more sound</li>
          </ul>

          <section>
            <h4>Avoiding Sentence Fragments and Run-Ons</h4>
            <p>Every sentence in formal expository writing must have an
              <b>independent clause</b>: a clause that contains a subject and a predicate. A
              <b>sentence fragment</b> has no independent clause; a
              <b>run-on sentence</b> has two or more independent clauses that are improperly connected.</p>
            <p>Beginning sentences with
              <b>coordinating conjunctions</b>—
              <b>for, and, nor, but, or, yet</b>, and
              <b>so</b>—is acceptable in moderation and is sometimes an effective stylistic choice to emphasize an idea. Nonetheless, check whether joining sentences with the conjunction or using an adverb, such as
              <b>moreover</b> or
              <b>however</b>, would be more effective.</p>

              <p>If some of the ideas are closely related, consider discussing them both in the same body paragraph. You may find that you don't actually have much to say about one or more of the points you jotted down—cross these out.

                  <b>Additional paragraphs, as time permits:</b> If you have time and have more strong points to make, you may write additional paragraphs in which you state and elaborate upon other points in support of your position.

              <p>You shouldn’t proceed with this step until you’ve completed the three preceding ones. You’ll save time and energy by preparing your essay before you start typing it. Graders have a limited amount of time in which to read your essay, so start and conclude with strong statements.

When you write crisply and give clear indicators of how one idea connects to the next, you will make your writing flow and make the grader's job easier.</p>

          <h3>The Argument Essay</h3>
          <p>Look carefully for unstated
            <b>assumptions</b> the writer makes in order to move from <b>evidence</b> to <b>conclusion</b>.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span class="step-info">
                <b> STEP 1</b>
              </span>
              <span class="step-title">
                Take the argument apart.</span>
              <p>The first step in analyzing an argument is to identify the conclusion. After you’ve nailed down the conclusion, your next step is to characterize the evidence used to support it. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="step-info">
                <b> STEP 2</b>

              <span class="step-title">
                Select the points you will make.</span>
              <p>Now that you clearly understand the argument, proceed to analyze it. You might do this by directly identifying the assumptions, by determining what type of evidence would fill in the gaps, or discussing whether the possibilities the author has overlooked could be better accounted for by another argument. Note, too, any terms that are ambiguous and would need definition for the argument to be clear. Finally, think of additional evidence that might be found that could strengthen or weaken the argument. Regardless of the variation in your approach, the argument will always be weak, and you will conclude your essay by saying that without additional evidence, the intended audience for the argument should be skeptical of its claim.</p>

              <p>If some of the potential flaws in the argument are closely related, consider discussing them both in the same body paragraph. You may find that you don't feel very confident discussing one or more of the points you jotted down—cross these out. Once any weak points are crossed out and related you don't just want to find fault with the argument. Make sure to discuss the evidence that, if the author included it, would make the argument more convincing. </p>

        <h2>How to Crack the Analytical Writing Section</h2>

        <section>
          <h3>How Will the Essays Be Scored?</h3>
          <p>Your essays will be read by two graders, and each will assign a score from 1 to 6, based on how well you do the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>follow the instructions of the prompt</li>
            <li>consider the complexities of the issue or argument</li>
            <li>effectively organize and develop your ideas</li>
            <li>support your position with relevant examples</li>
            <li>control the elements of written English</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To ace the Analytical Writing section, you need to take one simple step: Write as much as you possibly can. Each essay should include at least four indented paragraphs. Your Issue essay should be 400 to 750 words in length, and your Argument essay should be 350 to 600 words.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The Issue Essay</h3>
          <p>Our approach to the essays involves three steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Think</b>. Before you start writing, take a moment to brainstorm some thoughts about the topic.</li>
            <li><b>Organize</b>. Take the ideas you’ve come up with and fit them into the assignment for the prompt.</li>
            <li><b>Write</b>. Once you’ve completed the first two steps, the final step should be a snap.</li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>The <b>introduction</b> should introduce the topic of the essay, discuss the issues surrounding it, and present the essay’s thesis.</li>
            <li>The <b>body paragraphs</b> should use examples to support the thesis of the essay.</li>
            <li>The <b>conclusion</b> should summarize the major points of the issue, reiterate the thesis, and perhaps consider its implications.</li>
          </ol>

          <h5>Essay Essentials</h5>
          <p>A basic essay has three parts: an introduction, some body paragraphs, and a conclusion. These three things are exactly what you should include in your Analysis of an Issue Essay. Each of these parts has a specific role to play.</p>

          <h5>Key to High Score</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>considers the complexities of the issue</li>
            <li>supports the position with relevant examples</li>
            <li>is clear and well organized</li>
            <li>demonstrates superior facility with the conventions of standard written English</li>
          </ol>

          <section>
            <h4>STEP 1: THINK</h4>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Key Terms</b>. What are the key words or phrases in the prompt? Do the terms need clarifying before you can properly deal with them in the essay?</li>
              <li><b>Opposite Side</b>. What would the converse of the statement be?</li>
              <li><b>Examples</b>. What are some examples that would support the statement? What are some examples that would support the opposite statement?</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Key Terms</h5>
            <p>In order to make your essay as focused as possible, you might need to limit the key terms to a specific definition or interpretation. By repeatedly returning to these terms in your essay, you’ll convey the impression that your essay is strongly organized and on topic. Using key terms from the prompt throughout your essay contributes to its overall coherency.</p>

            <h5>Opposite Side</h5>
            <p>In order to score well on the Issue essay, you’ll have to consider both sides of the prompt. A simple “I agree, and here’s why” essay won’t be enough here; rather, you’ll need to consider both sides of the issue and state a clear position that you can defend.</p>

            <h5>Example</h5>
            <p>In general, the more specific your examples are, the better your essay score. And examples from history, literature, or current events are better than personal observations or experiences.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>STEP 2: ORGANIZE</h4>

            <h5>Separate Your Examples</h5>
            <p>Even though you might have a strong preference for one position on the issue, you might notice that the examples you brainstormed tend to support the other side of the issue. Don’t expend more time trying to think of examples to support your preconceptions; just write your essay supporting the other side!</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>STEP 3: WRITE</h4>

            <section>
              <h5>Preconstruction: The Introduction</h5>

              <ol>
                <li>clearly <b>establishes the topic</b> of the paper</li>
                <li>previews both sides of the issue at hand</li>
                <li>presents a clear thesis</li>
              </ol>

              <h6>Establish the Topic</h6>
              <p>Even though the grader will see the prompt you’re writing about, he or she should be able to figure out the prompt just from reading the introduction of your essay. There are a few different ways you can quickly establish the topic.</p>

              <ol>
                <li><b>Rhetorical Questions:</b> This approach is a tried-and-true way of introducing your topic. Instead of simply quoting or paraphrasing the prompt, turn it into a rhetorical question.</li>
                <li><b>Famous Quotations:</b> Another classic approach to beginning an essay is to use either a well-known saying or a famous quote from someone.</li>
                <li><b>Anecdote:</b> An anecdote is a brief story. Oftentimes you can grab your reader’s attention and introduce the topic with a good anecdote. When using an anecdote you might have to write a sentence or two explaining the relevance of your story.</li>
                <li><b>Fact/Statistic:</b> For some topics, it might be appropriate to start your essay by stating a fact or statistic.</li>
                <li><b>Definition:</b> One way you may wish to start your essay is by defining one of the key terms from the prompt. The advantage to this approach is that you already spent some time thinking along these lines when you were planning your essay.</li>
              </ol>

              <h6>Preview the Issue</h6>
              <p>Once you’ve told the reader what the topic is, your next task is to inform the reader of the issues at hand. You want to briefly touch on both sides of the debate, explaining the pros and cons of the prompt. A good way to accomplish this is to make use of strong transition words—words like <em>but, despite, while,</em> and <em>although</em>. Here are some examples.</p>

              <h6>Present the Thesis</h6>
              <p>A more important consideration when writing your thesis is giving some indication of why you hold your particular position. You should make it clear that you’ve thought about and analyzed the issue. Here are some examples of thesis statements. For each thesis, you can see that the author is also giving some justification for the viewpoint. This justification will be of course explored more thoroughly in the body paragraphs, but it’s good to give a preview of how your essay will take shape.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h5>Preconstruction: Body Paragraphs</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>use a good transition/topic sentence</li>
                <li>present an example</li>
                <li>explain how the example supports the thesis</li>
              </ol>

              <h6>Transition/Topic Sentence</h6>
              <p>Of course, you might want to avoid using simple transitions like “the first example,” and “the second example.” The important point is that each sentence introduces the example and reminds the reader of the purpose of the example.</p>

              <h6>Explain the Example</h6>
              <p>The purpose of the Issue essay is not to just list some examples; the purpose is to develop and support a position on the issue. Just as the topic of the essay should be clear from the introduction, the thesis should be clear from each body paragraph.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h5>Preconstruction: Conclusion</h5>
              <p>Your essay should always have a conclusion, for two reasons. First, a conclusion paragraph is evidence of good organization. It shows that you knew exactly what points you wanted to make, you made them, and now you’re ending the essay. And second, an essay that lacks a conclusion seems incomplete, almost as if your writing abruptly ends before it should. This can give a negative impression of your essay. Some test takers even prefer to write their introduction and conclusion first and then fill in the body paragraphs. This strategy has the advantage of making your essay seem complete even if you happen to run out of time writing the body paragraphs. Fortunately, conclusion paragraphs are easy to write. A good conclusion:</p>


              <h6>Summarize Main Points</h6>
              <p>Your conclusion should mention the thesis and how the examples support it. Additionally, you can briefly consider the implications of the thesis. </p>

          <h3>The Argument Essay</h3>

          <section>
            <h4>THE PARTS OF AN ARGUMENT</h4>

            <ol>
              <li>the <b>conclusion</b>-the author's opinion and recommendation for action</li>
              <li>the <b>premises</b>-the facts the author uses to back up his or her opinion</li>
              <li>the <b>assumptions</b>-unstated conditions that must be true in order for the argument to make sense</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>Conclusion Words</b>: <b><i>so</i></b>, <b><i>therefore</i></b>, <b><i>thus</i></b>, <b><i>hence</i></b>, <b><i>showed that</i></b>, <b><i>clearly</i></b>, <b><i>then</i></b>, <b><i>consequently</i></b>, <b><i>as a result</i></b>, <b><i>concluded that</i></b></p>

            <p><b>Premise Words</b>: <b><i>because</i></b>, <b><i>since</i></b>, <b><i>if</i></b>, <b><i>given that</i></b>, <b><i>in view of</i></b>, <b><i>in light of</i></b>, <b><i>assume</i></b></p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>ASSUMPTIONS</h4>
            <p>An assumption is an unstated premise that supports the author’s conclusion. There are three types of arguments you are likely to see. They are Sampling, Analogy, and Causal.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>The Sampling Assumption:</b> A sampling argument assumes that a small group is representative of a much larger group to which it belongs. To attack a sampling argument, show that one cannot assume that the opinions or experiences of the smaller group are necessarily representative of the larger group.</li>
              <li><b>The Analogy Assumption:</b> An argument by analogy assumes that A = B or that what is true for one entity will be true for another. To attack an argument by analogy, simply show that the two groups or places or individuals are nothing like each other. What is true for one does not have to be true of the other.</li>
              <li><b>The Causal Assumption:</b> A causal argument assumes that A causes B, or that if you remove the cause, you will remove the effect. While there may be a strong correlation between A and B, it does not always follow that it is a causal relationship or that A is the cause of B. To attack a causal relationship, point out that there are other possible causes for B and brainstorm some possible examples.</li>
            </ol>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>WRITING THE ARGUMENT ESSAY</h4>

            <ol>
              <li>Read the topic and identify the conclusion and the premises.</li>
              <li>Look for gaps in the argument, weaknesses in the logic, and new information in the conclusion that wasn't present in the premises. Brainstorm as many different assumptions as you can think of. Write these out on your scratch paper or on the computer screen.</li>
              <li>Select three or four of the strongest assumptions around which to build your essay.</li>
              <li>Choose a template that allows you to attack the assumptions in an organized way.</li>
              <li>Write the essay, using all the tools and techniques that you'll be learning in this chapter.</li>
              <li>Read over the essay and edit it.</li>
