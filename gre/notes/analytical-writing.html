          <h4>How to Approach the "Analyze an Issue" Task</h4>
          <p><b>Step 1: Brainstorm (3 Minutes)</b></p>
          <p>Once you read the task, you should spend time determining what stance you will take on the issue and what evidence you will use to support that stance.</p>

          <p><b>Step 2: Create Your Outline (3 Minutes)</b></p>
          <p>A good issue essay should consist of (1) an introductory paragraph that states your main point, (2) body paragraphs providing examples that reinforce this main point, and (3) a concluding paragraph that summarizes your point and its implications.</p>

          <p><b>Step 3: Write Your Body Paragraphs (5 Minutes per Paragraph)</b></p>
          <p>Start with your body paragraphs because these constitute the most important part of your essay. Each body paragraph should take the following structure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sentence 1: Topic sentence: State the point that you are trying to convey in the paragraph.</li>
            <li>Sentences 2 to 4: Example: Go into detail with the example that you are using to support your main point.</li>
            <li>Sentences 5 to 6. Reasoning: Explain how your example supports the topic sentence.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><b>Step 4: Write Your Introductory and Concluding Paragraphs (6 Minutes) </b></p>
          <p>The goal of your introductory paragraph is twofold:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Give context for the issue you are discussing.</li>
            <li>Clearly state your thesis—the stance that you will be trying to support in the essay.</li>
          </ol> 
          <p>To give context, you should first explain the larger relevance of the issue. To do so, it is oftentimes helpful to address the counterargument, a rhetorical strategy in which you provide the opposite side of the argument and then segue into your own opinion. </p>
          <p>The goal of your concluding paragraph is to summarize the points you made in your essay and to discuss the implications of your main point. When discussing the implications, you should focus on addressing the relevance of your thesis to issues outside the scope of the essay.</p>

          <p><b>Step 5: Proofread (3 Minutes) </b></p>
          <p>When proofreading, you should reread the essay carefully, focusing on any grammatical mistakes or typos you may have made. So worry less about the content and more about the technical aspects of your writing—the grammar, spelling, and fluidity of the sentences.</p>

          <h4>How to Approach the "Analyze an Argument" Task</h4>
          <p><b>Step 1: Read the Argument and Identify the Claim and Evidence (2 Minutes)</b></p>
          <p>When reading the argument, your goal is to identify the main conclusion the author draws and the evidence that he or she uses to support this conclusion.</p>

          <p><b>Step 2: Identify the Major Assumptions and Create Your Outline (3 Minutes)</b></p>
          <p> An assumption is an unstated piece of information that must be true for an argument to be valid. </p>

          <p><b>Step 3: Write Your Body Paragraphs (5 Minutes per Paragraph)</b></p>
          <p>In each body paragraph, you should examine a major assumption in the argument. Start by introducing the assumption. Then state why the argument actually depends on this assumption.</p>
          
          <p><b>Step 4: Write Your Introduction and Conclusion (7 Minutes) </b></p>
          <p>In the introduction, focus on restating the author’s main point, and briefly summarize why you think the argument is flawed. Make it obvious that there are important assumptions and flaws in the argument.</p>
          <p>Your conclusion does not need to include a restatement of the assumptions listed in your argument. Simply write a paragraph showing that you understand the author’s perspective but find it lacking.</p>

          <p><b>Step 5: Proofread (3 Minutes) </b></p>
          <p>When proofreading, you should reread the essay carefully, focusing on any grammatical mistakes or typos you may have made. So worry less about the content and more about the technical aspects of your writing—the grammar, spelling, and fluidity of the sentences.</p>

          <p>You should be familiar with the directions for the Argument task and with certain key concepts, including the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>alternative explanation</b>: a possible competing version of what might have caused the events in question; an alternative explanation undercuts or qualifies the original explanation because it too can account for the observed facts</li>
            <li><b>analysis</b>: the process of breaking something (e.g., an argument) down into its component parts in order to understand how they work together to make up the whole</li>
            <li><b>argument</b>: a claim or a set of claims with reasons and evidence offered as support; a line of reasoning meant to demonstrate the truth or falsehood of something</li>
            <li><b>assumption</b>: a belief, often unstated or unexamined, that someone must hold in order to maintain a particular position; something that is taken for granted but that must be true in order for the conclusion to be true</li>
            <li><b>conclusion</b>: the end point reached by a line of reasoning, valid if the reasoning is sound; the resulting assertion</li>
            <li><b>counterexample</b>: an example, real or hypothetical, that refutes or disproves a statement in the argument</li>
            <li><b>evaluation</b>: an assessment of the quality of evidence and reasons in an argument and of the overall merit of an argument</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No matter which approach you take, you should</p>
          <ul>
            <li>carefully read the <b>argument</b> and the specific instructions — you might want  to read them over more than once</li>
            <li>identify as many of the <b>argument</b>’s claims, <b>conclusions</b>, and underlying <b>assumptions</b> as possible and evaluate their quality</li>
            <li>think of as many <b>alternative explanations</b> and <b>counterexamples</b> as you can</li>
            <li>think of what specific additional evidence might weaken or lend support to the claims</li>
            <li>ask yourself what changes in the argument would make the reasoning more sound</li>
          </ul>
