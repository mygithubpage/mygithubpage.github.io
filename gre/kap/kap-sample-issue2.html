          <p>Begin by putting the issue in your own words: “If you expect people to do well, they will, and they will respect you for it.” Next, consider the other side of the issue and do the same: “If you expect too much of people, they may get frustrated and perform at a lower level, or you may lose their respect.”

      <p>High expectations yield high performance and respect in every case, whether the expectations are met or unmet. Setting expectations allows people to know how they will be measured and to what level they should perform. They also convey confidence and a sense of trust. Once the expectations are met, people feel bolstered by their achievement and have a much stronger sense of self-confidence, leading to even higher performance. These results hold up in a variety of contexts, including in educational, business, and political realms.
      </p>
      <p>The purpose of expectations is often lost in the assignment of a task. The expectations themselves may take the form of the actual tasks to be done, but really, the expectation is the ownership, resourcefulness, and skill of the person assigned the task. Expecting someone to do something overly challenging, such as asking second-graders to design a skyscraper or challenging a retiree to train for the Olympics, may seem egregious, but the stories that intrigue us most are usually about people rising to the challenge. Our own expectations are recalibrated when we learn of people exceeding the expectations we set ourselves to. We look to where the bar is set to see how we measure up. Given a bar, people will usually do what it takes to measure up.
      </p>
      <p>Good teachers are often described as “hard, but fair.” This is a good description of someone who holds high expectations for his or her students, and is rewarded by that assessment. A hard but fair teacher is one who challenges the students to exceed their own expectations of themselves, and often others’ expectations of them. These are the teachers who assign fourth-grade students research papers or ask eighth graders to take a 100-question math test in 100 minutes. Students take up the challenge because it feels good to succeed. They gain confidence and look at tasks unrelated to the classroom in new ways.
      </p>
      <p>High performance breeds higher performance. Once someone has been resourceful or learned a new skill to achieve a task, the person feels empowered to be similarly resourceful achieving different tasks. In fact, a high performer may take on more challenges without prompting. This bears out in business: the neophyte office intern who pulls together a critical report through resourcefulness, skill, and a little luck is a familiar story, but for good reason. This intern with his or her fresh ideas stands out among the drones and is challenged further, rocketing to the proverbial top of the company. If the same expectations were put on the rest of the workforce, would other employees be as resourceful to achieve the expectations? Most likely, as long as the employee is motivated enough by the challenge.
      </p>
      <p>Some people may be frustrated by high expectations, and some may simply ignore those expectations, but being presented with a challenge ultimately builds a person’s confidence. No one ever failed because he or she was fairly challenged by a daunting task and supported while tackling it. People fail because others do not value them enough and believe they are capable of less than they actually are. In fact, just being challenged is often enough to shake up people’s self-expectations and make them reconsider what they are actually capable of.
      </p>
      <p>In all cases, high expectations are worth the risk. The challenge bolsters self-esteem and self-confidence, and yields high performance. It improves performance in classrooms, on the job, and in other areas where challenges present themselves.

        <h6>Assessment</h6>
        <p>This essay is, on the whole, well constructed and laid out. The reader can systematically move from point to point as the writer examines the implications of the issue. The writer begins by agreeing with the statement and presenting specific reasons for agreeing. She gives examples to illustrate her point and organizes her essay well. The author’s analysis is generally cogent. She asks the reader to take a bit of a leap with some of her claims. For example, claiming that “people will usually do what it takes to measure up” when given a bar is a conclusion not really supported by the paragraph leading us to that conclusion. She asserts that people are inherently encouraged, rather than discouraged, by daunting challenges but never really justifies that assertion. However, the writing is clean and concise and includes only a few errors. Sentence structure is varied, and the author’s diction is strong and expressive. For all these reasons, this essay receives a score of 4.</p>
