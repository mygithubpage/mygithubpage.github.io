            <b>A</b>
            <p>The semicolon between these clauses is a straight-ahead road sign; these two ideas are closely related or elaborate upon each other. Since the blank is in the second clause, look to the first for direction. There you discover that this person always has to be right or have the last word in an argument. The second clause will be consistent with this notion; it explains just how much he needs to have the last word. He would rather be disliked than have what happen? A good prediction would be: “He’d rather be disliked than contradicted.” </p>
            <p>Choice <b>(A)</b><i>gainsaid</i> matches the prediction, but look at the others just to be sure. Scanning the other choices quickly, you see that all of the remaining options do not support the first part of the sentence. None of these other choices reinforces the idea that he always has to be right, so even if you aren’t familiar with the word <i>gainsaid</i>, you can still get the right answer. </p>

            <p>The first part of the sentence describes measures—namely, sanctions—that have been taken to stop a nation's actions in a disputed territory. The word "despite" at the beginning of the sentence acts as a detour road sign, indicating that the first half of the sentence contrasts with the second half. You can infer that the sanctions did not have the desired effect on the country and that it continued its undesirable activities.</p>
            <p>The first blank describes the type of country that would continue to use force in a disputed territory despite the threat of sanctions. You can predict the adjective "aggressive," which matches <b>(C)</b><i>truculent</i><b>(A)</b><i>desultory</i>, which means "lacking a plan," and <b>(B)</b><i>parsimoniou</i><i>s</i>, which means "frugal," do not make sense in this context.</p>
            <p>The second blank indicates what the nation has done to incur the threat of sanctions. Since the issue involves the disputed territory's borders, you can predict that the nation's armies entered the disputed territory unlawfully, which matches <b>(D)</b><i>breach</i><b>(E)</b><i>circumnavigate</i> means to "go around rather than through" an area, while <b>(F)</b><i>circumvent</i> means "to avoid altogether."</p>

            <b>B, E</b>
            <p>The context clues that point to the meaning of the first blank can be found both before and after the semicolon. In the first half of the sentence, the references to "hospitality" and being "welcomed as friends" indicate that the missing word refers to a group of people. In the second half of the sentence, this same group is described as "those who were traveling." You can, therefore, predict "travelers" for the missing word. This prediction matches <b>(B)</b><i>sojourners</i>, which refers to people staying in a place for a short time. Choice <b>(A) </b><i>adversaries</i> means "enemies," but no context clues indicate that the travelers are hostile. Choice <b>(C)</b><i>occupants</i> refers to people who live in a particular place, so it would be the opposite of "travelers."</p>
            <p>The second blank describes how ancient people viewed the law of hospitality. As the sentence states, this law was usually "grounded in religious belief" and "ensured basic survival" for travelers, so you can predict that this law was regarded as very important and even sacred. Eliminate <b>(D)</b><i> discretionary</i>, which means "optional," and <b>(F)</b><i>injudicious</i>, which means "foolish." Choice <b>(E)</b><i>sacrosanct</i>, which means "sacred" or "inviolable," is a strong match for the prediction and the correct answer.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="AE">
            <b>A, E</b>
            <p>The word "for" is a straight-ahead road sign that indicates that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the students' habits and the teacher's response. First, analyze the clues that point to the students' habits. The sentence states that the students were throwing away perfectly good food, so you can predict that they had "wasteful" habits. This prediction matches <b>(E)</b><i>prodigal</i> Eliminate <b>(D) </b><i>spartan</i>, which describes making do with very little rather than throwing away simple goods. Also eliminate <b>(F)</b><i>estimable</i>, as this means "admirable" or "praiseworthy."</p>
            <p>Now that you know the cause of the teacher's reaction, you can determine what kind of reaction she had. Since the teacher is described as "stern" and she is responding to the wasteful acts of her students, you can predict that she "criticized" her students' habits. This matches <b>(A) </b><i>lambasted</i>, which is the correct answer. Eliminate <b>(B)</b><i>commended</i>, since this is the opposite of the prediction, and <b>(C)</b><i>disregarded</i>, since a stern teacher, by definition, does not ignore her students' poor choices.</p>

            <b>B, F</b>
            <p>In this case, the second blank is easier to predict than the first, so start with that one. The word “almost” before the second blank tells you the correct choice will be a word that means nearly the same as “ornate.” Something <i>ostentatious</i> is considered showy, excessive, or ornate, so the correct choice is <b>(F)</b></p>
            <p>There are several road signs, key words, and phrases in this sentence that give clues. “Although” with “compared” tells you there is something different about the two houses. The detour road sign “although” allows us to predict that the choice in the first blank will have a meaning opposite to “ornate” and will be close in meaning to “plain.” Such a condition is not considered <b>(A)</b><i>impressive</i> or <b>(C)</b><i>desirable</i>, so the correct choice is <b>(B)</b><i>dilapidated</i></p>

The correct choice is <b>(A)</b></p>
            <p>For the second blank, the key phrase is “even the most forlorn”; “even” works as a detour road sign, and “forlorn” is negative, so you want a positive term. Since <b>(D)</b><i>despair</i> and <b>(E)</b><i>duress</i> are not positive, the answer is <b>(F)</b><i>ebullience</i></p>

            <p>The first blank describes the nature of the monarch's reign, which included "frequent shows of force" and "egregious violations of individual rights." These negative phrases indicate the first blank should mean something like "severe or harsh use of power." This prediction matches<b>(C)</b><i>draconian</i> Choice <b>(A)</b><i>inscrutable </i>means "incomprehensible," but no context clues indicate that the king's actions were difficult to understand. <b>(B) </b><i>mercenary</i>, which means "greedy," is a negative quality but not one supported by the clues.</p>
            <p>The second blank describes the king's acts of generosity. Since the king's reign was "characterized" by abuses of power, you can predict that it was unusual for the king to act in a generous manner. This prediction matches <b>(D)</b><i>intermittent</i>, which means "sporadic" or "irregular." <b>(E)</b><i>insipid</i> is the opposite and means "commonplace" and "boring," while <b>(F)</b><i>legitimate</i> means "lawful."</p>
            <p>To complete the third blank, note the detour road sign "rather than." The third missing word is thus set up to contrast with the phrase "benevolent king." These clues indicate that the king's legacy will reflect his reign, which was oppressive. You can predict that the king would be remembered as a tyrant, which matches<b>(H)</b><i>despot</i><b>(G)</b><i>prolocutor</i>, which means "spokesperson," lacks the negative charge needed here. <b>(I)</b><i>figurehead</i> is a term that describes a leader with no real power.</p>

            <p>The detour road sign "Although" indicates that there are two parts of the sentence that contrast with one another. The first blank refers to what the young woman claimed about her attitude toward the debate's outcome. This claim contrasts with the fact that she quickly reveals herself to be "opinionated." A good prediction for the first blank would be the phrase "impartial to," which matches <b>(A)</b><i>indifferent to</i> Choice <b>(B)</b><i>cognizant of</i> means "aware of," which does not match the prediction, and <b>(C)</b><i>partial to</i> is the opposite of the prediction.</p>
            <p>The second blank describes how the young woman's demeanor changed from "calm" to something else as she listened to one of the debaters. The change indicated that the young woman was not impartial but actually "opinionated," so you can predict that her demeanor became either noticeably positive or negative. Eliminate <b>(D)</b><i>phlegmatic</i>, which means "calm," and <b>(E)</b><i>conciliatory</i>, which describes something that is meant to calm. Choice <b>(F)</b><i>cantankerous</i> means "argumentative," which fits the predicted meaning.</p>
            <p>The third blank describes the type of issue that is being debated.

            <p>The detour road sign "While" indicates that the "taint of scandal" followed the executive in spite of the ethics committee's actions. Since the second half of the sentence has a negative tone and is set up to contrast with the first half, you can infer that the ethics committee did something positive for the executive who was accused of a scandal. A strong prediction for the missing word would be "acquitted" or "cleared of wrongdoing."

            <p>Choices <b>(A)</b><i>discharged</i> and <b>(C)</b><i>dismissed</i> may have been tempting answer choices since they are synonyms.

          <p><p>Although it is an imperfect model for describing a complex market, the theory of supply and demand is a reasonably accurate method of explaining, describing, and predicting how the quantity and price of goods fluctuate within a market. Economists define supply as the amount of a particular good that producers are willing to sell at a certain price. For example, a manufacturer might be willing to sell 7,000 sprockets if each one sells for $0.45 but would be willing to sell substantially more sprockets, perhaps 12,000, for a higher price of $0.82. Conversely, demand represents the quantity of a given item that consumers will purchase at a set price; in the most efficient market, all buyers pay the lowest price available, and all sellers charge the highest price they are able. The intersection of these occurrences is graphically represented in supply and demand curves that show the prices at which a product becomes too expensive or too readily available.</p>

            <p>The abstract concepts addressed in the passage are those of supply and demand, and the only example that illustrates supply and demand occurs in sentence 3.
