              <p>The key phrase is “suggested by,” which indicates this is an Inference question. The correct answer is not explicitly stated in the text but can be discerned by an accurate reading of the text. </p>

            <li><span class="step-info"><b> STEP 3</b></span><span class="step-title">Research the relevant section in the text.</span>
              <p>This Inference question does not point to a particular statement in the passage, so you cannot research a particular sentence or section of the passage before approaching the answer choices. However, you can review your passage map so you have a firm grasp of the big picture of the passage; answer choices that contradict this or lie outside the scope of the passage can be eliminated. If any choices remain, you’ll need to check each one against the information provided in the text until you find one that is fully supported.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="step-info"><b> STEP 4</b></span><span class="step-title">Make a prediction.</span>
              <p>Because of the open-ended nature of the question, you cannot formulate a precise prediction. However, your review of the passage map shows that because Spalding wanted to market baseball to Americans, he spread the story about an American, Doubleday, inventing it, even though Spalding had little evidence of this. Look for an answer choice that aligns with this main thrust of the passage, and look to eliminate choices that do not align.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="step-info"><b> STEP 5</b></span><span class="step-title">Evaluate the answer choices.</span>
              <p>Eliminate choice
                <b>(A)</b> because it contradicts the main thrust of the passage, which is that “most baseball historians,” and the author, agree that Doubleday did not invent baseball. This was just a story that Spalding made up. Choice
                <b>(B)</b> might require some research. Spalding did make sporting equipment, and he was an avid promoter of baseball. However, he had a number of connections to baseball, and nowhere is it implied that he wanted to expand the fan base for the sport to increase sales of equipment. Choice
                <b>(C)
                </b> is Outside the Scope; the passage says that evidence for Doubleday’s inventing baseball is very weak, but it never discusses who did invent the sport. Choice
                <b>(E)</b> can be researched in the last sentence, which mentions that “other members of [Spalding’s] commission” promoted the story about Doubleday. However, the passage never says whether they believed the story or were skeptical of it. The correct answer is choice
                <b>(D)</b>, which is supported by evidence in the passage. Spalding and his commission were eager to spread a story about an American inventor because they knew it would help market the sport to Americans.

            <li><span class="step-info"><b> STEP 2</b></span><span class="step-title">Analyze the question stem.</span>
              <p>The phrase “based on the passage” means this is an Inference question. As with all GRE Inference questions, while the correct answer(s) won’t be directly stated in the passage, it or they must be true given what is stated in the passage.

              <p>This is another open-ended Inference question. Again, use your passage map to refresh your memory of the key ideas of the passage—any choice that contradicts these or is a 180°, wanders Outside the Scope, or is too Extreme can be eliminated immediately. Be prepared to research any remaining choices in the appropriate place in the text.

              <p>While a precise prediction is not possible, having read the passage strategically and already answered one open-ended Inference question about it, you have a strong sense of what kinds of statements would and would not be supported by the text.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="step-info"><b> STEP 5</b></span><span class="step-title">Evaluate the answer choices.</span>
              <p>Choice
                <b>(A)</b> is Outside the Scope of the passage, which only concerns whether Doubleday invented baseball; it does not discuss whether he existed at all. Choice
                <b>(B)</b> can reasonably be inferred. According to the second sentence, Spalding was a baseball player, manager, and owner, and according to the last sentence, he was a member of a commission that promoted the sport. In addition, he is believed responsible for perpetuating a widely believed myth about the origins of baseball. Thus, he was certainly influential in the game, and
                <b>(B)</b> is correct. Choice
                <b>(C)</b> is supported by the third sentence, in the middle of the passage, which describes cricket as a game “similar” to baseball. The similarity of the games was a reason Spalding was so eager to differentiate baseball by inventing an American origin story.
              </p>
              <p>Now try a select-in-passage question. There is no need to approach this type of question any differently. Indeed, you can think of it as a multiple-choice question. There are five sentences in this passage, so they are your five answer choices.</p>

              </span>
              <p>A key to choosing the correct answer to select-in-passage questions is to read the question very carefully. A rushed reading might focus on words like “Abner Doubleday” and “baseball,” and the test taker might think, “The whole passage is about that. How do I figure out which sentence to pick?” The words pointing you to the one and only sentence that fits the bill are “there was only one piece of evidence” for the Doubleday story. Only one sentence discusses the evidence for this origin myth.

            <li><span class="step-info"><b> STEP 5</b></span><span class="step-title">Evaluate the answer choices.</span>
              <p>You might recall that the passage begins by presenting background information and introducing the topic, that the story about Doubleday was largely the creation of Spalding. Only later does the passage discuss how Spalding came up with the story. So begin your scan for the correct sentence at the end of the passage. You’ll quickly find the fourth sentence:
                <b>Spalding’s entire basis for the foundation of baseball history lay in a handwritten letter from 1907 that he said came from a man who claimed to have gone to school with Doubleday and attributed the invention to him.</b> That fits the criteria of the question perfectly.
              </p>
              <p>Some test takers feel less comfortable with passages about certain topics. Readers with a strong background in science may feel nervous about humanities passages, and readers well versed in the social sciences may approach physical science passages with some anxiety. However, the Kaplan Method and your strategic reading skills work equally well for all passages, no matter what your personal familiarity with the subject matter.

              <p>The key word “suggests” means this is an Inference question. This question asks about a specific idea in the passage, “tea subjected to an aging process.” The correct answer(s) must be true given the information that is provided in the passage.

              <p>The “tea subjected to an aging process” discussed in the passage is black pu-erh tea. According to the passage map, black pu-erh tea is different from other teas in two ways: it contains lovastatin, and it has an unusual flavor.

                <b>(A)</b> is Half-Right/Half-Wrong: the passage states that pu-erh contains “not as much” caffeine as other black teas, so the aging process can be inferred to remove some caffeine.

              <p>The word “inferred” leaves little doubt this is an Inference question. Again, this question is directed at specific information in the passage—this time what the passage says about black teas.

            </li>
            <li><span class="step-info"><b> STEP 3</b></span><span class="step-title">Research the relevant section in the text.</span>
              <p>Review what the passage says about black teas. In discussing the processing steps that differentiate types of tea, the passage says that pu-erh tea is oxidized but that what makes it different from black tea is that it is also aged. Therefore, black teas are also oxidized, but they are not aged. The passage also says that most black teas contain more caffeine than black pu-erh. Moreover, the passage says that pu-erh is like “all other teas” in containing antioxidants, so black teas must contain antioxidants.

                <b>(D)</b> says black teas are oxidized but not aged and is correct.Choices
                <b>(A)</b> and
                <b>(B)</b> both use comparisons between black teas and other teas that the passage does not support. Although the author says it is necessary to have an “adventurous palate” to enjoy pu-erh tea, this does not mean that people with adventurous tastes will prefer pu-erh tea to others; perhaps they will enjoy all kinds of tea equally. Therefore, choice
                <b>(C)</b> is incorrect. Because all teas contain antioxidants, which may protect against cancer,
                <b>(E)</b> is incorrect.

              <p>Now apply your Reading Comprehension skills to a longer passage, this one with a topic in the social sciences.

            <b>(C)</b> is incorrect. One can infer that freelancers enjoy the freedom of this mode of work and this may be why they choose self-employment, but explaining this is not the author’s primary goal. Choice

          <p>Based on the passage, one can infer that the author would likely agree with all of the following statements about self-employed freelancers EXCEPT</p>
          <p><b>Step 2:</b> The word “infer” signals an Inference question. Even if the word “infer” were not present, you could still tell that this is an Inference question from the phrase “the author would likely agree,” which implies that you are being asked to make an inference rather than find a detail explicitly stated in the passage. Careful! This is an EXCEPT question, so you will need to rule out those choices the author would agree with. And because this is an all-that-apply question, there may be more than one correct answer—that is, more than one answer choice the author would NOT agree with.
          </p>
          <p><b>Step 3:</b> Use your passage map to refresh your memory of ideas the author has stated and therefore would agree with. The question hasn’t given you any guidance about where in the passage to research, so save that effort until you have answer choices to evaluate.
          </p>
          <p><b>Step 4:</b> You can’t formulate a specific prediction for a question like this one. After all, there are an infinite number of ideas the author would not agree with. However, in Step 5 you can compare the answer choices to ideas you know the author
            <i>would</i> agree with and eliminate them. On the cross-out list are these (from the passage map): freelance workforce is growing; knowledge workers are in the best position to freelance; freelance workers identify with their job title, not a company, and they work at home alone and are self-reliant; growth of freelance workforce means society is becoming less cohesive; both freelance and traditional workers face insecurity. Having a list like this in mind and using it to eliminate incorrect answer choices—a kind of “reverse prediction”—sets you up for success.
          </p>
          <p><b>Step 5:</b><b>A, C</b></p>
          <p>In the first paragraph, the author says the demand for freelancers is increasing in part because companies want a workforce they can “adjust at will.” In the last sentence, the author concludes by saying that freelancers have a “degree of vulnerability” that gives them common ground with other workers. Therefore, freelancers are not always financially secure, and the author would disagree with choice
            <b>(A)</b>, making it a correct answer to this EXCEPT question.
          </p>
          <p>In the second paragraph, the author states that freelancers integrate different aspects of their own lives but are less connected to coworkers, resulting in an “atomization of society.” They do build networks, the author says, but mostly with people similar to themselves. Therefore, the author would disagree with choice
            <b>(C)</b>, making this choice another correct answer. In paragraph 1, the author contrasts knowledge workers with a coffee shop barista and indicates that professionals with “intellectual capital are in prime position” to succeed as freelancers. Therefore, the author would agree with choice
            <b>(B)</b>, and this choice is incorrect.

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="E">
          <p>The author mentions “government-administered unemployment payments” in paragraph 2 in order to</p>
          <p><b>Step 2:</b> The phrase “in order to” tells you this is a Logic question. You are being asked
            <i>why</i> the author mentions this detail, not for further information about it.
          </p>
          <p><b>Step 3:</b> According to your passage map, paragraph 2 is about the social consequences of the growth in the freelance workforce, specifically how this trend is causing society to become less cohesive. Reading the target sentence, you find the contrast key words “instead of”: “company benefits” and “unemployment benefits” are being contrasted with freelance workers’ “attempt[s] to provide for themselves.” The next sentence continues the contrast, starting with the word “[n]ot” and saying freelance workers reject “communal benefits.”
          </p>
          <p><b>Step 4:</b> Predict that the author mentions this detail to support the idea that in contrast to traditional employees, freelance workers depend on themselves rather than on society.
          </p>
          <p><b>Step 5: E</b></p>
          <p>Read the lines around the quoted text in the passage and consult your passage map to answer this Logic question: the purpose of paragraph 2 is to argue that the increase in freelancers has profound social implications, namely that freelancers’ work and personal lives are more integrated but these workers are less integrated with society. “Government-administered unemployment payments” are mentioned in a sentence that contrasts programs organized to protect the well-being of a group with the self-reliance of freelancers. Therefore, this detail is mentioned to support the idea that self-employed people are less connected to the social safety net, and answer choice
            <b>(E)</b> is correct.
          </p>
          <p>Although the author implies elsewhere that freelancers are vulnerable to financial insecurity, the detail in this question is mentioned to support the idea that freelancers provide for themselves, not that sometimes they cannot do so; choice
            <b>(A)</b> is incorrect. If anything, the author seems troubled by the effect of a larger contingent labor force on society, so choice
            <b>(B)</b> does not work. Freelancers are self-reliant, according to the author, so
            <b>(C)</b> does not make sense. Finally, although it might logically follow that people who do not receive unemployment benefits should not pay unemployment taxes, the passage never discusses taxes of any kind, and choice
            <b>(D)</b> is out of scope.

        <p>Many baseball enthusiasts are aware of the story of how Abner Doubleday invented the game of baseball with some friends in 1839 and introduced it to a nation during the Civil War. However, most baseball historians now agree that this story is a convenient fiction, propagated by Albert Spalding, a player, manager, owner, and one of the first manufacturers of sporting equipment. Spalding’s desire to distinguish baseball, which so keenly mirrored American interests and pursuits, from similar games played in England, such as cricket and rounders, led Spalding to seek out a purely North American origin of the sport. Spalding’s entire basis for the foundation of baseball history lay in a handwritten letter from 1907 that he said came from a man who claimed to have gone to school with Doubleday and attributed the invention to him. Despite the speculative and dubious claims of the letter, Spalding and other members of his commission were quick to adopt the narrative as gospel and began to market their sport to the masses as a truly American pursuit.

        <p>Many tea drinkers believe that different teas—black, green, oolong, and so forth—come from different plants. In fact, however, all tea leaves come from
          <i>Camellia sinensis</i>, a large evergreen shrub. Native to China, the plant is now cultivated throughout Asia and in Africa, Europe, and North and South America. The character of various teas depends in some measure on the climate and soil where the plant is grown but mostly on how the leaf is processed after it is harvested. An interesting case is black pu-erh tea, a specialty of China’s Yunnan province. Unlike green or oolong tea, black pu-erh tea undergoes an oxidation process with the help of naturally occurring enzymes or, in the world of tea, is said to be “fermented.” It then undergoes an additional step that differentiates it from other black teas: after oxidation, the leaves are aged in humid conditions, sometimes for several decades. Like all other teas, pu-erh contains antioxidants, which may help protect regular consumers from some cancers. It also contains caffeine, though not as much as most other black teas. What really sets it apart from all other teas is the fact that it naturally contains small quantities of lovastatin, a medication that physicians prescribe to lower cholesterol. It is possible that certain fungi that colonize the tea leaves produce lovastatin as a metabolic by-product. Most pu-erh connoisseurs, while appreciative of the tea’s potential health benefits, are more intrigued by its taste, which they describe with words such as
          <i>woody</i>,
          <i>earthy</i>, and
          <i>leathery</i>. Clearly, an adventurous palate is necessary to enjoy this unusual beverage. Fortunately, those seeking a more conventional tea flavor have many options.

        <p>As the business world becomes ever more globalized and dynamic, freelance knowledge workers have come into their own. Technology drives rapid change in products and markets, and to keep up, companies find value in an on-demand workforce, one that they can adjust at will as new skills are needed. At the same time, the Internet means that a worker across the country or on the other side of the world can be as connected to a project’s workflow as someone seated in the company’s headquarters. Reflecting this reality, the U.S. Census Bureau’s count of “nonemployer businesses” rose 29 percent from 2002 to 2012, and according to one study, 53 million Americans—more than one-third of the workforce—engage in freelance work. The growth of so-called contingent labor is forecast to continue unabated. Clearly, not all labor is equally empowered in the new paradigm. The barista placing the artistically styled froth on a customer’s latte must be in the coffee shop. However, the systems analyst upgrading the shop’s financial system that tracks the sales of lattes can be anywhere. Thus, workers with intellectual capital are in prime position to choose where they work and for whom.

        <p>The transition to a labor market of independent professionals has social and cultural implications. In much of the world, work is a major source of identity, so when work changes, identity changes. Instead of identifying as Widgets Incorporated employees who, whether they are an executive or a janitor, will someday earn a gold watch with the Widgets logo engraved on the back, workers identify as designers or social media gurus or software engineers. Rather than forging a common bond with coworkers in a mix of jobs around the proverbial water cooler, freelancers build geographically dispersed networks with other self-employed professionals with similar skill sets. Furthermore, in the twenty-first century the workplace has become a primary site of social connections and thus an important thread in the fabric of social cohesion, but instead of going to an office for a large portion of the day where they assume their workday persona, the new entrepreneurs work at home—even in bed, where they tap out messages to clients on their smartphone while wearing pajamas. And instead of relying on company benefits packages when working or government-administered unemployment payments when not working, these workers attempt to provide for themselves in defiance of the vicissitudes of life. Not partaking in any communal safety net, they argue that in an era when layoffs are commonplace, being self-employed is little more precarious than working for an employer. The cumulative result of these changes may be, on the one hand, an integration of personal and work life not seen since the Industrial Revolution moved people from farms into factories and, on the other hand, the atomization of society as individual contributors of labor rent themselves out impermanently to companies around the globe without meeting their coworkers face-to-face. Contributing further to social disruption is the bifurcation of the labor market into the independent self-employed and those still dependent on traditional jobs. It remains to be seen whether this new generation of professionals will appreciate the degree of vulnerability that accompanies their freedom and reach out to find common cause with employees who still draw a steady paycheck, working together to address issues of security and dignity in the workplace.

However, the team is doing poorly, and this is “difficult” for everyone because it does not make sense. In other words, it is hard to understand. The answer choice most like “understand” is
                <b>(A)</b><i>fathom</i>.
              </p>

              <p>Plugging the selected words into the sentence fits the context: “Everyone believed the team was favored with athletic talent and a seasoned, successful coaching staff; consequently, it was difficult to
                <i>fathom</i> why the team was
                <i>floundering</i> so badly against one of the worst teams in the division.”

              <p>In this sentence, there are clues in the phrases “no resolving the matter” and “strained and fragile,” which, along with the straight-ahead road signs “since” and “and,” suggest that the correct answers are going to describe or support a conflict between disagreeing parties. In this example, you may already sense the words that complete at least one of the blanks just from the construction of the sentence.

                <b>(G) </b><i>acrimony</i>, or bitter feelings, between the two sides.

              <p>One way to determine the correct answer in this sentence is to figure out the part of speech of the missing word. The missing word in this sentence is an adjective because it modifies the noun “nature.” Another clue in this sentence is the key word “volunteer.” A volunteer is someone who offers her time or skills without pay. The blank will be an adjective with a positive connotation that describes the type of person who volunteers.
