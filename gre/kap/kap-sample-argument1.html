      <h4>Question</h4>
      <p>The problem of poor teacher performance that has plagued the state's public school systems is bound to become a good deal less serious in the future. The state has initiated comprehensive guidelines that oblige teachers to complete a number of required credits in education and educational psychology at the graduate level before being certified.</p>

          <p>Your scratchwork might look similar to this example:</p>
          <p>Paragraph 1: The argument is that improved academic training, specifically graduate-level credits in education and psychology, will substantially alleviate the problem of poorly performing teachers.
          </p>
          <p>Paragraph 2: The author assumes that classroom instruction in education will improve teachers’ classroom performance—that this is the knowledge teachers need and/or the way they should learn it. However, classroom courses in education and educational psychology may or may not address the cause of the problem. Indeed, perhaps the poor teachers have already taken the specified courses yet are still ineffective.</p>
          <p>Paragraph 3: The author assumes some connection exists between certification under the new guidelines and actually teaching in the classroom. However, already-certified poor teachers may still be teaching in the future (without the training), and not-yet-certified teachers may not be hired in the public schools. </p>
          <p>Paragraph 4: If a similar state has instituted similar guidelines and seen improvement in teacher performance, then the argument would be stronger. Evidence that certification equates to actual teaching (there is a plan to remove uncertified teachers, and there's a budget to hire new teachers) would also strengthen the argument.</p>
          <p>Paragraph 5: The author relies upon unsupported assumptions, and people who care about the public schools should doubt that teachers will soon be more effective as a result of this plan.</p>

      <h5 class="no-ov">Sample Argument Essay 1</h5>
      <p>The argument that improved academic training, in the form of required credits in education and psychology, will substantially alleviate the problem of poorly performing teachers may seem logical at first glance. However, the author relies on unsupported assumptions about what kind of development teachers need and mechanisms for replacing poor teachers with newly certified teachers. Therefore, the argument is fundamentally flawed and unconvincing.</p>
      <p>First, the writer assumes that the required courses will produce better teachers. In fact, the courses might be entirely irrelevant to the teachers’ failings. Suppose, for example, that the main problem lies in cultural and linguistic misunderstandings between teachers and students; graduate-level courses that do not address these issues would be of little use in bridging these gaps and improving educational outcomes. Furthermore, the writer assumes that poorly performing teachers have not already taken these courses. If the state's teachers have already undergone such training but still fail to serve their students, then requiring them to take the classes again is unlikely to address the problem. In fact, the writer establishes no correlation between the teachers' classroom performance and their academic coursework.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, the writer provides no evidence that poorly performing teachers who are already certified will either stop teaching or will undergo additional training. In its current form, the argument implies that only teachers seeking certification, who may or may not be teachers already in the system, will receive the specified training. Furthermore, the author fails to establish a link between becoming certified and actually being hired in the public school system. If school systems have budget shortfalls and institute a hiring freeze, then newly certified teachers may not enter classrooms for quite some time. Unless there is a way to transition poor teachers out of the classroom and ensure teachers with proper training are soon hired, the bright future the writer envisions may be decades away. </p>
      <p>The notion that the specified coursework will create better teachers would be strengthened by evidence that the training will address barriers to educating students. For example, if a state with similar demographics had implemented similar guidelines and then seen either improved learning as measured by standardized tests or improved teaching as documented by teacher observations, then one could conclude with more confidence that the guidelines should be implemented in this state. Also, the author would be considerably more persuasive if she showed that a plan is in place to either require all teachers to gain this certification or terminate poor performers without the certification. The author should also demonstrate that the public schools have the budgets to hire newly certified teachers so they can begin to have an effect on students.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the writer is not necessarily mistaken in stating that the state’s comprehensive guidelines will lead to improvement in educational outcomes in public schools. After all, the additional training would probably not adversely affect classroom performance. However, to support the assertion that the guidelines will effectively solve the state’s problem, the writer must first define the scope of the problem more clearly and submit more conclusive evidence that the new requirements will, in fact, improve overall teaching performance. Without such evidence, stakeholders in the public school system, including parents, administrators, and legislators, should be skeptical that education will improve anytime soon.</p>

        <h6>Assessment</h6>
        <p>This outstanding response demonstrates the writer’s insightful analytical skills. The introduction recaps the argument and clearly states that it is flawed, noting two of the prompt’s unsupported assumptions. The writer follows up with a one-paragraph examination of these two serious flaws in the argument. Specifically, the author exposes these points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The assumption that the required courses will produce better teachers, including the assumption that the proposed training is what teachers need and that poor teachers have not already had this training</li>
          <li>The lack of evidence that ineffective teachers currently working will stop teaching and be replaced by newly certified, and presumably more effective, teachers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before wrapping up, the author details what kind of evidence would address these assumptions, bolstering the argument. Each point receives thorough and cogent development (given the time constraints) in a smooth and logically organized discourse. This essay's language is economical and error-free, with sentences that vary in length and complexity, while the diction and vocabulary stand out as both precise and expressive.
