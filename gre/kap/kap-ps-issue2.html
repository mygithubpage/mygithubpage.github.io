      <h5 class="no-ov">Essay 2: “Outstanding,” Score of 6</h5>
      <p>Keeping up with global progress is, doubtless, a desirable attribute of any society. However, to purport that the reasons certain societies may not progress at the same rate as “great” societies are their reluctance to break out of their comfort zone and their fear of the unknown is to present an overly simplistic view. Such a view does not take into consideration the set of economic, political, and cultural constraints that affect every society’s ability to progress on a global scale.
      </p>
      <p>Before exploring these constraints, it would be useful to examine the use of the word “great” in the above context. The concept of what makes a society great is highly subjective; some may equate greatness with military might or economic dominance, while others would emphasize cultural achievement or progress in care for less privileged citizens. Whatever one’s definition of greatness, however, it is ludicrous to suggest that any society actively rejects the desire to be great. Many societies face the seemingly insurmountable struggle to maintain societal structure in the face of economic need or political upheaval; the desire for greatness can emerge only when a society’s basic structure is intact.
      </p>

      <p>Societies facing severe economic challenges are virtually unable to progress in areas such as medicine, military power, and agriculture even if they want to do so. Countries like Bolivia use a majority of their limited resources to maintain the status quo of their largely agrarian society. Bolivian farmers are not afraid of the unknown or passively content with their current situation, but are using all of their resources to sustain their families and maintain the social structure of their villages. Given this situation, the luxury of advancements in medicine, technology, and military power is simply not possible.
      </p>
      <p>Also, societies embroiled in political upheaval, such as South Sudan, are unable to send their young and talented members to university where they can spearhead progress; the most vigorous segments of the population are required to serve in the military or to care for their families through difficult economic and political times. Maintaining societal coherence amid chaotic conditions engenders a lack of progress, as it is generally measured, but as we have seen throughout time, episodes of great drama in any given society can yield important works of art. One such example is Albert Camus’
        <i>The Stranger</i>, written during the French Resistance. Another, more current example is
        <i>They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky</i>, Benjamin Ajak's autobiographical novel about Sudanese boys fleeing that country's civil war.</p>
      <p>Another point to consider is that, in some cases, an entire society’s cultural history, including its artistic contributions, is preserved only through its living members’ rich oral tradition and their active rejection of change in the realms of technology and science. This is evident when considering the Amish, whose motivation for using horse-drawn buggies and refusing access to the Internet lies, not in fear or discomfort, but in a conscious desire to sustain a traditional way of life that they find sometimes difficult but always valuable. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, to devalue a society that is not among the most progressive in the world is to discount the contributions a so-called “unprogressive” society can make, such as artistic and cultural expression unique to that society. Progress is a valuable tool for the advancement of a society, but blindly reaching for greatness can lead to a society’s downfall just as much as ignoring it altogether can. The balance between accepting a society’s constraints and highlighting its strengths is what will ultimately lead to a society’s greatness.

        <h6>Assessment of Essay 2</h6>
        <p>This is a particularly insightful essay. The argument developed in this essay asks the reader to question certain presuppositions about what constitutes “greatness” as the term is applied to a society. Instead of merely answering the question of whether the progress of society is hindered by clinging to traditional views and obsolete ways of thinking, the essay forces the reader to reconsider what progress actually entails. Thus, the essay has the potential to elicit the cultural bias of the reader and force him to confront it. The author challenges the received notions of “great” and “progress” as “an overly simplistic view.” From there, she proceeds to defend her position by examining different cultural contexts and how we might understand “greatness” within those contexts. The essay is well constructed; the author begins by providing examples of how greatness must be understood contextually. She then adds several examples, such as French and Sudanese novels, to illustrate greatness produced under conditions that would seem to block progress of any sort. The writing is clear and direct, contains few errors, and reveals skillful use of diction. For all these reasons, this essay receives a score of 6.
