      <h4>Question</h4>
      <p>The commercial airline industry in the country of Freedonia has experienced impressive growth in the past three years. This trend will surely continue in the years to come, since the airline industry will benefit from recent changes in Freedonian society: incomes are rising; most employees now receive more vacation time; and interest in travel is rising, as shown by an increase in media attention devoted to foreign cultures and tourist attractions.</p>

          <p>Paragraph 1: The conclusion is that the positive growth in Freedonia’s commercial airline industry will continue. The evidence is that income, vacation time, and interest in travel are all on the rise. However, a good deal more evidence is required before one can accept the conclusion.</p>
          <p>Paragraph 2: The author assumes that positive economic conditions will continue. However, the cause of these conditions is not explained, so we need to ask whether the factors generating economic growth are stable or likely to subside. The author also assumes that consumers will put their money toward airline travel instead of other goods/services, so we need to know more about what people are likely to do with their discretionary income.</p>
          <p>Paragraph 3: The author assumes that the increased media attention to foreign cultures and tourist attractions is either a response to public interest in travel or is stimulating this interest. However, no connection between the topics of media coverage and a desire to travel is established. A question worth asking is whether the media are covering foreign cultures more because media executives have evidence of the public's increased interest in traveling to other countries or for some other reason. It's also worth asking whether people who see such content are more likely to travel by air.</p>
          <p>Paragraph 4: The author assumes that the airline industry will benefit from a better economy and more interest in foreign travel. However, Freedonia's airline industry is not necessarily positioned to expand. We must ask whether the industry has the capacity to grow further—the supply of labor and capital and adequate infrastructure in the form of airport runways and terminals must be in place. Or is the better economy a result of conditions that would inhibit air travel?</p>
          <p>Paragraph 5: If inquiries turn up evidence that contradicts the author’s assumptions, then Freedonia’s airline industry might not experience further growth or may even suffer a downturn in the future.

      <h5 class="no-ov">Sample Argument Essay 2</h5>
      <p>The author concludes that the positive growth in Freedonia’s commercial airline industry will continue for years to come. The evidence is that incomes, vacation time, and interest in travel are all on the rise. While this argument may seem tenable at first glance, the conclusion relies on assumptions for which there is no clear evidence.
      </p>
      <p>First, the writer assumes that the favorable economic conditions in Freedonia will continue. It is entirely possible that they will not, and that employees will have neither the money nor the vacation time necessary to pay for expensive foreign vacations. Suppose, for example, that incomes do not continue to rise. People would not have the money to spend on expensive vacations. Also, people may choose to spend their money on other luxuries besides travel. Airline industry analysts should ask whether economic factors are likely to stay positive.</p>
      <p>Secondly, do we really know that the citizens of Freedonia will
        <i>want</i> to spend their money on vacations? Also, how do we know they will want to visit places that necessitate air travel? True, there is more media attention on foreign cultures and tourist attractions, but the argument would be stronger if the author provided evidence of a direct relationship between this media content and a desire to spend disposable income and vacation time traveling. The author does not explain where this interest comes from. Also, even if people are interested, it does not necessarily follow that they will be either willing or able to indulge that interest with extravagant holidays, since there could be an economic downturn.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the writer does not explain what relation, if any, these economic conditions have to the airline industry. What if the changes in Freedonian society that have led to higher incomes and more vacation time do not help the airline industry? Perhaps the economic changes are the result of protective tariffs and trade policies that make it harder for Freedonians to conduct business internationally. Perhaps the government is limiting imports and exports. Or maybe all the airports are as big as cities will allow them to be, so airlines can have no more planes. We need this information because if these possibilities could shrink the growth of the airline industry.
      </p>
      <p>If the writer has made wrong assumptions regarding Freedonian society, the prospects of the commercial airline industry in Freedonia are less rosy. It would mean that there will be less income and less interest in foreign travel.</p>

        <h6>Assessment</h6>
        <p>This essay is reasonably well constructed throughout, enabling the reader to move from point to point as the writer examines the multifaceted implications of the issue. The writer correctly identifies and articulates several assumptions that the argument makes and does an adequate job of pointing out how what questions need to be asked (what additional evidence is needed) to enhance the argument's cogency. The essay suffers because the writer jumps around a little bit, mixing the points about economic trends and consumer choices between the second and third paragraphs. Also, the explanation of the economic climate of Freedonia and its implications for foreign travel is slight. Finally, the author’s conclusion does not do a particularly good job of restating the author’s position effectively. The writing itself is direct and includes relatively few errors. Sentence structure is not particularly varied, and the word choice and vocabulary are adequate. For these reasons, the essay earns an “Adequate” score of 4.
