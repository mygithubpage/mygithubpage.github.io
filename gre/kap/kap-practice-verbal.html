          <p>Cdivor is primarily a psychdivogical construct, and therefore the study of physics is not relevant to an understanding of how cdivor is perceived.
          </p>
          <p>The phenomenon of cdivor is a combined effect of the wavelength of light that shines on an object, the wavelength of light reflected by the object, and the human mind’s perception of the light stimulus that comes to the eye.</p>
          <p>Scientists have determined that although people may perceive cdivor differently in different situations, cdivor is an immutable characteristic of objects.
          </p>
          <p>Creative professionals, such as artists and interior designers, view cdivor significantly differently than do scientists.</p>
          <p>To say that an object is a particular cdivor is meaningless because cdivor is a subjective perception influenced by experience, culture, and context and cannot therefore be ascertained to be a specific physical characteristic.

        <div class="answer" data-answer="B">
          <div class="explanation">
            <p>In the first paragraph, the author states that color is not only a function of wavelength, and then the key word “However” signals what color actually is: “not merely” a physical property “but rather” the product of an interaction among the object’s properties (specifically, how it reflects light), the light itself, and the human observer. The rest of the passage elaborates on this interaction of the physical properties of light and the perception of light. Answer choice
              <b>(B)</b> states this idea and is correct.
            </p>
            <p>Choice
              <b>(A)</b> is extreme because of the words “primarily” in the first part and “not relevant” in the second part; in the last sentence of paragraph 1, the author says the study of color is appropriate for both psychology and physics. The word “immutable” in choice
              <b>(C)</b> means “unchanging” and thus directly contradicts the main idea of the passage, which is that color is a construct of multiple factors and these factors can vary for any given object. Choice
              <b>(D)</b> might be inferred from the passage, but this is not the main point of the passage, which is about the nature of color and not about people’s reactions to color. Choice
              <b>(E)</b> is extreme due to the word “meaningless.” Although objects may appear different colors to different people under different conditions, and one can never be sure what another person means by the word
              <b>red</b>, the author never says it is without meaning to, for example, describe an apple as red.

            <p>To prepare to answer this Inference question, review the points the author has made in the passage. The correct answer must be true given what the author has said. In paragraph 3, the author states that the color of an object changes depending on nearby colors. Therefore, answer choice
              <b>(A)</b> is supported.
            </p>
            <p>Choice
              <b>(B)</b> misuses the detail that blue is not the favorite color of most Chinese. This does not mean that no Chinese person would like an electric blue sofa—after all, most people own objects of many colors, including colors that are not their favorite—and some Chinese people may prefer blue. Choice
              <b>(C)</b> is not supported. Using low-saturation or grayish tones next to each other can result in colors looking different than they would in isolation or next to other colors, but it does not result in different people perceiving the colors differently. Choice
              <b>(D)</b> is a distortion. The passage states that an item of an intermediate color that is placed near a color-wheel-adjacent primary color, such as orange placed near red, will look more like the primary color on the other side of it (orange next to red will look more yellow). Nothing suggests this effect is undesirable, so choice
              <b>(D)</b>’s “should not” is unsupported. Also, the passage only discusses the interaction of intermediate and primary colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, but this answer choice refers to any intermediate color being placed next to red. Finally, although one artist, Josef Albers, worked with color in this way, the passage does not suggest that artists in general “often” do this, and choice

        <p>Among the earliest published literature by African Americans were slave narratives—autobiographical accounts of the lives of slaves who lived primarily in the American South in the early to mid-1800s. These accounts—which included letters, notes, and diaries—often discussed escapes, slave auctions, interactions with plantation owners and abolitionists, and the forced separation of family members, often parents and children. Some of the best-known slave narratives were written by Josiah Henson and Frederick Douglass. In the last three decades, a renewed awareness of the lives of enslaved African Americans has prompted a wave of novels and biographies, sometimes called “neo-slave narratives,” in which modern writers such as Toni Morrison and Octavia Butler offer a historical or fictional representation of the lives of slaves.

        <p>The problematic relationship between Heidegger’s political views and his seminal status as a philosopher is a continuing point of contention in the historical assessment of his achievements. His contributions to Continental philosophy in works such as
          <i>Sein und Zeit</i> have been read, in some circles, through the critical lens of his affiliation with National Socialism in Nazi Germany during the Second World War. His writing during that time covered a broad range of subjects, including philosophy, politics, and aesthetics. His work on ontology directly influenced his contemporary philosophical thinkers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre. Though he is widely regarded within philosophical circles as one of the preeminent luminaries, along with Husserl, in the modern development of ontology, certain scholars and thinkers militate against the value of his thought in its entirety. To regard Heidegger’s work highly would be, in their eyes, to absolve him of his support of the politics of Nazism, even though he is being evaluated solely on the basis of his contributions to the study of philosophy and not in any political context.

        <p>A common misconception is that color refers only to a wavelength of light in the visual spectrum, from about 400 nanometers (violet) to about 700 nanometers (red). When an object reflects light of a given wavelength, we see that object as the corresponding color. So, for example, we might see a Braeburn apple as red and a Granny Smith apple as green because they reflect light of different wavelengths. However, color is not merely a property of an external physical object but rather the result of an interaction among that object, the light that shines on it, and, finally but most significantly, the manner in which the human eye and brain make sense of the reflected light stimulus. Thus, the study of color can properly fall as much within the realm of psychology as that of physics.
        </p>
        <p>Experience is one psychological factor that informs our perception of color. For example, a child eating by a campfire that emits a great deal of yellow light may believe that the melted Cheddar cheese served on white bread on a white paper plate is actually a white cheese like Swiss or Monterey Jack. This occurs because the yellow light reflects off both the plate and the bread, which the child knows are white, and off the cheese, which the child isn’t sure about. All the objects therefore appear to be the same color, and the child assumes that color is white. On the other hand, an adult with experience viewing things in firelight would intuitively adjust her perception to account for the yellow light and would not make the same mistake.
        </p>
        <p>Color is also perceived differently depending on its context. The noted abstract painter Josef Albers produced an influential body of work based on this phenomenon, including his series
          <i>Homage to the Square</i> featuring nested squares of different colors. In one psychological experiment testing perception, the letter
          <i>X</i> is presented against two colored backgrounds. Although the letter is identical each time it is presented, it appears olive green in one context and lavender in the other context. This effect is achieved when the
          <i>X</i> is given a low-saturation blue color, or gray-blue, and the backgrounds are also low-saturation colors with hues on either side of blue on the color wheel. Because blue falls between purple and green on the color wheel, a gray-blue
          <i>X</i> against a gray-purple background will look gray-green, or olive, and the same
          <i>X</i> against an olive background will look gray-purple, or lavender. In a similar manner, an intermediate color will look different against different primary color backdrops; teal, for instance, will look green against a blue background and blue against a green background.
        </p>
        <p>Other subjective factors also influence the experience of color. These include cultural norms (Westerners most often name blue as their favorite color, whereas in China red is preferred) and simply what we learn about color. Consider that if a child learns that stop signs are “red,” the child will call them “red.” Another person in that society will also have learned to call stop signs “red.” However, whether the two people are experiencing the same color is unknown since that experience exists only in the mind. Therefore, if one were to tell an interior designer that color is an immutable physical property of objects, one would meet with skepticism. Before placing the electric blue sofa in a client’s living room, the designer considers the color of light the various light fixtures will emanate, the colors of the carpet and walls, and her client’s feelings about electric blue, which after all may not even be the same color in the client’s mind as it is in the designer’s.

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>The sentence begins by telling you that Jon only cares about getting an A, and then it says that the team project did not impact his grade. The blank needs a term for how Jon “felt” about the project, and the key words “so because” indicate that the blank will be consistent with the information given. Furthermore, the key word “and” in the last part of the sentence means the blank will be consistent with Jon not doing his share of the work. Predict that Jon will not care about the team project or will feel “indifference” toward it. Answer choice (A)
              <b>apathy</b> is a match for your prediction and the correct answer.
              <b>Apathy</b> is composed of
              <b>a</b>–(“not”) and
              <b>path</b> (“emotion”) and is related to words like
              <b>empathy</b>,
              <b>sympathy</b>, and
              <b>antipathy</b>. Learn these words as a group with the same root.</p>
            <p>The word
              <b>zeal</b> (“strong interest”), choice
              <b>(B)</b>, is the opposite of what is needed. Note that
              <b>zealous</b> means “very enthusiastic” and a
              <b>zealot</b> is “a fanatic” for some cause. Another word beginning with
              <b>z</b>,
              <b>zest</b>, also means “great enthusiasm.” Learn these words as a group with related meanings. Choice
              <b>(D)</b>
              <b>cheerful</b> is incorrect for the same reason; it is positive, but you need a neutral or mildly negative word. Choice
              <b>(C)</b>
              <b>loathing</b> means “extreme dislike” and choice
              <b>(E)</b>
              <b>antagonism</b> means “dislike” or “conflict”; both words are too negative. While Jon does not care about the project, he has no reason to hate it. When you studied literature, you may have learned that the
              <b>protagonist</b> is the main character of the story and the
              <b>antagonist</b> is the person with whom the main character experiences conflict.</p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>The sentence says that Lovia had never been interested in travel but she is going to Thailand. Her decision would come as a “surprise” to her friends, and choice
              <b>(B)</b>
              <b>astonishment</b> is correct for blank (i). There is no evidence to support the idea that her friends are feeling either
              <b>delight</b>

              <b>dismay</b>
              <b>(C)</b> about her decision. You need a neutral word for this blank.</p>
            <p>Lovia will be abroad for a year, so the choice that fits blank (ii) is
              <b>(D)</b>
              <b>sojourning</b> (“staying temporarily”). This word is related to
              <b>journey</b>, which also relates to travel, and to

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>People can “express” a wide range of thoughts and feelings (blank (i)), and tax rates can go up, go down, or stay the same (blank (ii)). Start with the third blank, which has the most context clues.</p>
            <p>The word for blank (iii) must be consistent with the last part of the sentence, which is about not letting people keep their money—or taking their money away from them. The match is choice
              <b>(H)</b>
              <b>confiscatory</b> (“seizing property”). This word’s root is the same as in the word
              <b>fiscal</b>, meaning “financial”: your
              <b>fiscal</b> condition is reduced if the authorities
              <b>confiscate</b> your property. Choice
              <b>(G)</b>
              <b>congruent</b> means “in agreement”; when you study geometry for the Quantitative section, you will study
              <b>congruent</b> shapes, which are identical to or in complete agreement with each other. Choice
              <b>(I)</b>
              <b>consummate</b> when used as an adjective means “perfect.” This has the same root as
              <b>summit</b>, or “highest point,” and if someone describes you as the
              <b>consummate</b> professional, she is saying that you bring together (
              <b>con–</b>) the highest or best qualities of a professional.</p>
            <p>Given that the tax rates might become
              <b>confiscatory</b>, the citizens must be concerned that taxes will “rise,” so this is your prediction for blank (ii). Choice
              <b>(E)</b>
              <b>escalated</b> is correct. Think of riding up an
              <b>escalator</b> in a building. Or think of
              <b>scaling</b>, or climbing, a wall—
              <b>escalate</b> and
              <b>scale</b> share the same root. Choice
              <b>(D)</b>
              <b>economized</b> would relate to “spending less money,” and choice
              <b>(F)</b>
              <b>elaborated</b> would mean “to develop.” Neither of these choices describes rising taxes.</p>
            <p>Now for blank (i): Because the citizens believe taxes will go up and take most of their money, and they are meeting with their senator about this prospect, they are undoubtedly worried. Choice
              <b>(C)</b>
              <b>apprehension</b> conveys worry or fear and is correct.
              <b>Apprehension</b> is an interesting word because it can mean “capture,” “understanding,” or “fear.” Here’s a sentence to think about: If the criminal had
              <b>apprehended</b> that the police would soon
              <b>apprehend</b> him, he would have felt
              <b>apprehension</b>. Choice
              <b>(A)</b>
              <b>euphoria</b> means “bliss” and is the opposite of what these folks are feeling. Choice
              <b>(B)</b>
              <b>composure</b> means “calm” and also does not reflect what the citizens feel.</p>

              <b>dogma</b> and

            <p>Elena liked Joe, but the key word “but” indicates she has a negative view of his friends. Why? They are “pseudointellectuals” and their theories are “inane.” The prefix
              <b>pseudo</b>– means “fake,” and
              <b>inane</b> means “silly.” Either one of these clues tells you that they don’t understand the complex philosophies mentioned in the sentence. Predict that the word in the blank means their “interpretations” are actually misinterpretations; that is, they are “false.” Choices

              <b>spurious</b> and
              <b>(C)</b>
              <b>fallacious</b> both relate to “falseness” and fit the sentence. The word
              <b>spurious</b> is derived from the Latin word for “illegitimate child.” It is not etymologically related to the word
              <b>spur</b>, but you can think of a railroad spur, which looks like any other track but is not the main line and doesn’t go very far.
              <b>Fallacious</b>, like

              <b>bellicose</b> means “looking for a fight” (the root is

              <b>eulogy</b> with an
              <b>elegy</b>: Both are often written about someone who has died, but a eulogy is prose while an elegy is a poem and the focus of a eulogy is on praising the subject while an elegy’s focus is on expressing grief. Choices

However, both mean “to express disapproval,” and while the sentence indicates that nature lovers reject staying in a hotel for themselves, there is no evidence that they disapprove of other people staying in hotels.</p>
