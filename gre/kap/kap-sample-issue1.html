      <h5 class="no-ov">Sample Issue Essay 1</h5>
      <p>A range of well-developed energy technologies are currently available to industries and individual consumers: oil, coal, natural gas, hydroelectric, and nuclear power each contribute to our economy and our lifestyle, enabling us to live with one of the largest "environmental footprints" in human history. Despite each of these energy sources' benefits, each also has drawbacks that make it unsustainable for the long term. Therefore, it is imperative that alternative power-generating technologies be developed.</p>
      <p>Despite extensive regulation and efforts to make our predominant energy sources environmentally safe, all have negative effects on the environment and thus on human safety. Burning coal and oil causes air pollution. Drilling for oil and transporting it via pipelines raises the specter of oil spills. Increasingly, extracting oil and natural gas is being accomplished through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), a process associated with contamination of water supplies and increased incidence of earthquakes. Hydroelectric power depends on damming rivers, exacting a tremendous cost on the wildlife that depend on these freshwater lifelines; moreover, climate change will put increasing pressure on rivers and lakes. The most recently developed of these technologies, nuclear energy, is inexpensive in the short term, causes no air or water pollution under normal operating conditions, and uses a virtually inexhaustible fuel supply. However, even this solution has long-term consequences that render it unacceptable, as it creates radioactive waste that requires storage for thousands of years, and the plants themselves can suffer accidents that release radiation, as witnessed at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, Chernobyl in Ukraine, and Fukushima in Japan. Because no energy source we currently rely on can be trusted not to irreparably harm the planet we live on, these technologies need to be phased out in favor of better alternatives.</p>
      <p>Beyond the enormous long-term environmental problems and short-term health risks, current energy sources impose economic costs on consumers. By being relatively inexpensive in the short term, they make other alternatives seem too costly. Thus, for example, electric utilities maintain coal-burning and nuclear plants, their costs underwritten by rates that fail to cover the externality of environmental damage. Power companies also save money whenever regulations are not written as strictly as needed to protect the environment or when regulatory enforcement is postponed. In the meantime, companies trying to develop innovative energy supplies struggle to find reliable funding. If the true costs of power generation were being levied, consumers would feel much more motivated to switch to other types of energy. Currently, however, artificially low costs are prolonging usage of unsustainable technologies. </p>
      <p>Indeed, the companies that produce power often claim they cannot make more environmentally friendly alternatives affordable. Yet there already exist homes heated by the sun, cars fueled by corn, and cities lit up in no small part by the wind. If the limited resources devoted to such energy alternatives have already produced such consequential results, more intensive investment would likely make these alternatives less expensive, perhaps even more cost-effective than the forms of energy now offered as the most economical solution. Another argument against sustainable energy is that it is unreliable, for example, that solar works only when the sun is shining and wind works only when a breeze is blowing. It must be remembered, though, that older power technologies were unreliable early in their development, but successive engineering refinements made them the seemingly indispensable mainstays of a developed economy they are today. Set against whatever inconvenience they may engender is the fact that sunlight, air, and plants are in virtually limitless supply and do not inherently create harmful environmental impacts. </p>
      <p>Thus, those who argue that alternative energy sources are too expensive and unreliable are being shortsighted. In fact, the current energy supply imposes tremendous indirect costs in its threat to the health of humans and the environment at large, and engineers have barely begun to tap the potential of other energy sources. Not only are the drawbacks to conventional energy too great to justify its continuing use, but the long-term benefits of renewable resources will likely reward investment in their development. If these alternatives are explored more seriously than they have been, they have the potential to be transformative technologies in the same way that the refinement of petroleum revolutionized transportation and manufacturing and massive hydroelectric projects powered development of the western United States. With limited resources at our disposal and a burgeoning global population to consider, we should not delay in diverting resources from traditional to innovative energy sources.</p>

        <h6>Assessment</h6>
        <p>This essay is carefully constructed throughout, enabling the reader to move effortlessly from point to point as the writer examines the multifaceted implications of the issue. The writer begins with a strong thesis statement (“it is imperative that alternative power-generating technologies be developed”) to introduce his own position on the issue. He proceeds to provide compelling reasons and examples to support the premise. Along the way, he acknowledges arguments for the other side (the energy industry is regulated, current energy sources are inexpensive, and the "claim" that alternative sources are not affordable), thus "consider[ing] ways in which the statement might or might not hold true," but also effectively rebuts these arguments. The final paragraph takes the argument to an effective conclusion. The writing is clear, concise, and correct. Sentence structure is varied, and diction and vocabulary are strong and expressive.
