      <h5 class="no-ov">Essay 1: “Outstanding,” Score of 6</h5>
      <p>Perceptions of greatness in national and political leaders are largely determined by the seriousness of the problems that they face during their terms in office. Most national histories principally highlight individuals in the context of significant events in which the leaders played important roles. Most political leaders need to have large stores of inherent skill and ability just in order to become a political leader. However, history remembers those who lived in great times more fondly than those who did not. Examples of this are numerous and include the histories of Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill—all people who are perceived as great leaders largely because of the times in which they lived.
      </p>
      <p>Abraham Lincoln is often considered the greatest of all the American presidents. His image graces two units of the currency, and he has one of the largest monuments built in his honor in Washington, D.C. However, Lincoln is considered great largely because he faced a great challenge—the civil war between the North and the South in the 1860s. Lincoln led the United States to victory over the rebels and reunited the country and is therefore considered an impressive leader. This is not to say that Lincoln was not skilled. Many know that he was born in a log cabin and progressed to law school and eventually to the presidency. He was also a skilled orator. However, another man, James Buchanan, also was born in a log cabin, went to law school, gave good speeches, and ascended to the presidency, yet there are no monuments to Buchanan in the capital or pictures of his face on the five-dollar bill.
      </p>
      <p>Woodrow Wilson was another talented person who ascended to the presidency of the United States. However his talents are not what make his perceived greatness. In this age, few remember whether Wilson was particularly smart, a very good speech maker, or a good arbitrator. Most remember that he led the United States to victory in the first World War and therefore perceive him as an effective leader. At the time, however, Wilson was rather unpopular. In fact, he had so little sway with Congress that he was unable to get the United States to join the League of Nations—a fact that many claim helped lead to the second World War.

      </p>
      <p>Winston Churchill was another person whom history views favorably because of the incredible challenges that he faced. However, Churchill was not very popular with the British public before World War II, nor did he impress a future US president. When Franklin Roosevelt first met Churchill, before either was the leader of his respective country, Roosevelt wrote in his diary that the Englishman was full of himself and far too talkative. Early in his term as prime minister, Churchill even faced a no-confidence vote in Parliament. However, the events of World War II accorded him the perception of greatness in the eyes of history.
      </p>
      <p>Many might argue that these individuals and other men and women were already great before history gave them great challenges. While it is impossible to definitely disprove this assertion and they must in fact have had certain skills and abilities—otherwise, they would not have been political leaders—most examples point to the fact that the times make the man or woman. If the presidencies of Buchanan and Lincoln were switched, we would very likely have the Buchanan memorial instead. In summary, it is true that the perceived greatness of a political leader is more due to great challenges than superior inherent ability. The historical examples of Lincoln, Wilson, and Churchill bear this out. All were talented, but so too are all political leaders. Only the leaders that live in eventful times are remembered as great.

        <h6>Assessment of Essay 1</h6>
        <p>This essay is particularly well constructed; the author begins by discussing the qualities of political leaders and how they are presented in history books. He asserts his position, “people . . . are perceived as great leaders largely because of the times in which they lived” clearly and effectively and previews the three examples he will use to support this compelling evidence, drawing on his knowledge of three historical figures who are, by consensus, regarded as great. He is particularly effective in contrasting the example of Lincoln with that of Buchanan, who had a similar background but served as president under less trying circumstances. The writing is largely clear and direct, with skillful use of diction and few errors. For all these reasons, this essay receives a score of 6.
