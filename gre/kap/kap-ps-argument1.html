      <h4>Question</h4>
      <p>The following appeared in the City Council Proceedings section of the local newspaper in Smithville.</p>
      <p>“The city council of Smithville has recommended making changes to police procedures to improve the visibility of the police force. These changes include hiring more police officers, budgeting more funds for police overtime, and directing officers to patrol significantly more often on foot rather than from their patrol cars. These improvements in visibility would significantly lower the crime rate in Smithville and make its citizens feel safer.”

      <h5 class="no-ov">Essay 1 : “Outstanding,” Score of 6</h5>
      <p>The city council of Smithville believes that increasing the visibility of its police force will reduce crime and increase the safety of its citizens. However, the memo provides no evidence to support this argument, and the city council may not be taking other variables, alternative solutions, or the citizens’ desires into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Smithville city council assumes that crime persists because the city’s police force has too low a profile, but the memo never cites evidence to support this position. The council could do something as simple yet effective as asking the town librarian to review published studies to see whether a parallel exists between a high police presence and reduced crime rates. It could also hire an independent research firm to determine whether a correlation exists between Smithville crime scenes and a lack of police activity.
      </p>
      <p>The council should consider other factors that might account for the current crime rate. The police force may be undertrained or poorly managed. If so, adding more officers or encouraging officers to work longer hours could actually compound the problem. Here again, research could be a vital ally in the council’s case: What have other towns with similar problems identified as causal factors? What training do their police forces receive? How are they deployed, on foot or in patrol cars? Answering questions like these might help clarify a solution to the town’s problem. The council should also research historic solutions to the problem: How have towns like theirs reduced a growing crime rate? This research could bolster the council’s position or uncover alternative, less costly solutions to crime-fighting.
      </p>

      <p>The council also assumes that a higher police presence automatically reduces citizen concerns over crime, but it doesn’t take into consideration the relationship between the residents and the police. Some communities regard police officers with a great deal of distrust, and that attitude may be pronounced in a community where the police force is perceived as unable to cope with crime. Has the community itself, through its elected leaders, the police chief, op-ed pieces in the newspaper, or community groups, expressed a need for a stronger police force? The memo never says.
      </p>
      <p>As it currently stands, the Smithville city council’s memo announces a recommendation that appears to have been made in a vacuum. To convince citizens that bolstering the police force and changing patrol procedures is the way to fight crime, the memo needs to state how the council arrived at this decision. Only then can citizens feel that the council is taking the right course of action.

        <h6 class="no-ov">Assessment of Essay 1</h6>

        <p>The author successfully identifies and analyzes this argument’s recommendation: that the way for Smithville to lower its crime rate and improve citizen safety is to increase police visibility.
        </p>
        <p>In the opening paragraph, the essay restates the argument and then cites its unsupported assumptions. In the following four paragraphs, the author insightfully discusses the assumptions and perceptively suggests what information would help in evaluating the recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>Specifically, the author cites these points undermining the argument:</p>
        <ol class="list-bullet">
          <li>The assumption that a higher police profile will lower the crime rate</li>
          <li>The assumption that no other cause exists for the high crime rate but low police visibility</li>
          <li>The lack of research into historically successful alternative solutions (the assumption that no such alternatives exist)</li>
          <li>The assumption that the town’s citizens will agree that the council’s solution is the right one and thus "feel safer"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Throughout the essay, the author uses well-organized paragraphs—each starts with a broad statement followed by supporting statements—and her ideas logically flow from one sentence to the next. She uses succinct diction and alternates complex and simple sentences.
        </p>
        <p>The essay concludes strongly by summarizing the evidence necessary for the council to authoritatively recommend that higher police visibility will reduce crime and increase citizen safety. The essay remains focused and clear throughout, earning a score of 6.
