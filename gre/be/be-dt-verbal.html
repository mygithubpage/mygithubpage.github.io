            <p>1. (C), (D) Both <i>apt</i> and <i>prone</i> have several meanings. <i>Apt</i>, for example, can mean appropriate, as in an apt remark, or it can mean unusually quick and intelligent, as in an apt pupil. <i>Prone</i> can mean prostrate; it can also mean having a downward slope. Here both apt and <i>prone</i> are used in the sense of inclined or liable. Note the use of <i>indeed</i> to both confirm and emphasize the preceding statement.

          <p>James's first novels used conventional narrative techniques: explicit characterization, action that related events in distinctly phased sequences, settings firmly outlined and specifically described. But this method gradually gave way to a subtler, more deliberate, more diffuse style of accumulation of minutely discriminated details whose total significance the reader can grasp only by constant attention and sensitive inference. His later novels play down scenes of abrupt and prominent action, and do not so much offer a succession of sharp shocks as slow piecemeal additions of perception. The curtain is not suddenly drawn back from shrouded things, but is slowly moved away. Such a technique is suited to James's essential subject, which is not human action itself but the states of mind that produce and are produced by human actions and interactions. James was less interested in what characters do, than in the moral and psychological antecedents, realizations, and consequences which attend their doings. This is why he more often speaks of "cases" than of actions. His stories, therefore, grow more and more lengthy while the actions they relate grow simpler and less visible; not because they are crammed with adventitious and secondary events, digressive relief, or supernumerary characters, as overstuffed novels of action are; but because he presents in such exhaustive detail every nuance of his situation. Commonly the interest of a novel is in the variety and excitement of visible actions building up to a climactic event which will settle the outward destinies of characters with storybook promise of permanence. A James novel, however, possesses its characteristic interest in carrying the reader through a rich analysis of the mental adjustments Of characters to the realities of their personal situations as they are slowly revealed to them through exploration and chance discovery.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="C">
            <p>7. (C) The author states that the later novels of James play down prominent action. Thus, they lack <i>overtly</i> dramatic incident. the author goes on to state that James's novels <i>do</i> possess interest; they carry the reader through "a rich analysis of the mental adjustments of the characters to the realities of their personal situations." It is this implicitly dramatic psychological revelation that sustains the reader's interest. Question A is unanswerable on the basis of the passage. It is evident that James wrote psychological novels; it is nowhere stated that he originated the genre. Question B is unanswerable on the basis of the passage. Although conventional narrative technique relates in distinctly sequences," clearly separating them, it does not necessarily recount action in <i>strictly</i> chronological order. Question D is unanswerable on the basis of the passage. The passage does not deal with the public's reaction to James. Question E is unanswerable on the basis of the passage. The passage talks of qualities in James a novelist in terms of their being <i>characteristic</i>, not in terms of their making him <i>unique</i></p>

            <p>8. (C) In the third sentence the author describes James's later novel as offering "slow piecemeal additions of perception." To clarify the process, he goes on in sentence four to paint a picture in words, using figurative language. No literal curtain is drawn away here; however, the image of a curtain being slowly drawn away helps the reader develop a feeling for James's method of psychological revelation. </p>

          <p>According to the theory of plate tectonics, the lithosphere (earth's relatively hard and solid outer layer consisting of the crust and part of the underlying mantle) is divided into a few dozen plates that vary in and shape; in general, these plates move in relation to one another. They move away from one another at a mid-ocean ridge, a long chain of sub-oceanic mountains that forms a boundary between plates. At a mid-ocean ridge, new lithospheric material in the form of hot magma pushes up from the interior. The injection of this new lithospheric material from below causes the phenomenon known as sea-floor spreading. </p>
          <p>Given that the earth is not expanding in size to any appreciable degree, how can "new" lithosphere be created at a mid-ocean ridge? For new lithosphere to come into being in one region, an equal amount of lithospheric material must be destroyed somewhere else. This destruction takes place at a boundary between plates called a subduction zone. At a subduction zone, one plate is pushed down under another into the red-hot mantle, where over a span of millions of years it is absorbed into the mantle.</p>

          <p>The stability that had marked the Iroquois Confederacy's generally pro-British position was shattered with the overthrow of James Il in 1688, the colonial uprisings that followed in Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland, and the commencement of King War against Inuis XIV of France. The increasing French threat to English hegemony in the interior of North America was signalized by French-led or French-inspired attacks on the Iroquois and on outlying colonial settlements in New York and New England. One high point of the Iroquois response was the spectacular raid of August 5, 1689, in which the Iroquois virtually wiped out the French village of Lachine, just outside Montreal. A counter-raid by the French on the English village of Schenectady in March 1690 instilled an appropriate measure of fear among the English and their Iroquois allies. </p>
          <p>Tne Iroquois position at the end of the war, which was formalized by treaties made during the summer of 1701 with the British and the French, and which was maintained throughout most of the eighteenth century, was one of "aggressive neutrality" between the two competing European powers. Under the new system the Iroquois initiated a peace policy toward the "far Indians," tightened their control over the nearby tribes, and induced both English and French to support their neutrality toward the European powers by appropriate gifts and concessions.</p>

            <p>(A)  The Iroquois were able to respond effectively to French acts of aggression.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="E">
            <p>18. (E) Lines 23â€”34 indicate that in the early 1700s and through most of the eighteenth century the Iroquois <i>did</i> receive concessions from the European powers. Therefore, Choice E is the correct answer. Choice A is incorrect. The raid on Lachine was an effective response to French aggression, as was the Iroquoisenforced policy of aggressive neutrality. Choice B is incorrect. James II's overthrow was followed by colonial uprisings. Choice C is incorrect. In response to the Iroquois leaders' supposed favoring of the British, the French initiated attacks on the Iroquois (lines 7â€”13). Choice D is incorrect. This sums up the policy of aggressive neutrality. </p>

          <p>A recent assessment of the status of global amphibian populations identified habitat loss as the single greatest identifiable factor contributing to amphibian declines. Habitat loss primarily results from the residential, agricultural, arboricultural, or recreational development of an area. </p>
          <p>Anthropogenic conversion of land has significant reductions in the wetland, and grassland habitat that amphibians require for their survival. Outright habitat loss probably has the greatest effect on amphibians, but habitat degradation, or the general decline in the health of a habitat, often from environmental contamination, the introduction of exotic invasive species, or a reduction in required resources within a habitat, and similarly affects amphibians. Likewise, habitat fragmentation (the disruption or fragmentation of habitat into discontinuous or isolated remnants of viable habitat) emerges from isolated patches of habitat loss and can often have delayed effects on animal populations.</p>
