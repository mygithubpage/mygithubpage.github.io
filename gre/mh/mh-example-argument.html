        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>Ever since our company downsized in 2009 by reducing the number of customer support staff, we have seen a decrease in revenue. Customers have expressed frustration over the lack of available staff members, and customer surveys have shown that these customers wish we were available to help them outside of normal business hours. The obvious solution to our problem of decreasing revenues is to increase the size of the customer support staff to what it was before we downsized in 2009.</p>
        <p>Write a response in which you examine the stated or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on the assumptions and what the implications are if the assumptions prove unwarranted. </p>

        <h4>Strategies</h4>
        <p><b>Paragraph 1: Argument flawed b/c many assumptions.</b> Not obvious that more cust. supp. = more revenue</p>
        <p><b>Paragraph 2: First assumption:</b> How important is customer service to getting business? If people still give business despite bad customer service, then new support staff won’t matter.</p>
        <p><b>Paragraph 3: Second assumption:</b> Could the loss in revenue have been due to other factors? Was the economy bad? Did other parts of the company decline during this time period?</p>
        <p><b>Paragraph 4: Third assumption:</b> What was the previous customer support staff like? Were they better than the current ones? If so, would new ones be as good as the old ones? If new hires are not as good as the old staff, then hiring new personnel might not solve the problem.</p>
        <p><b>Paragraph 5: Conclusion:</b> Even though there’s a correlation b/w loss in staff and revenue, it’s not obvious that the loss in staff led to the loss in revenue. Need to address a lot of other factors before deciding that they should hire more customer support staff.</p>

        <p>Though it would appear that the company’s declining revenues would be bolstered by the addition of customer support staff, the author does not make a logical case for adding more customer support staff. On its face, it might appear that the provided data lead to the author’s conclusion, but there are several unwarranted assumptions that must be addressed to establish the soundness of the author’s case.</p>
        <p>The author uses the correlation between the loss of revenue and decrease in customer support during the same time period to conclude that the business will benefit by hiring additional customer service employees. However, the author commits a logical fallacy by equating correlation and causation. The fact that the loss of revenue coincided with this decrease in staff is not enough to conclude that the loss in revenue was caused by the decrease in staff. Perhaps the economy was bad during this time period, and the company lost revenues because its clientele did not have as much disposable income. Or perhaps there were other segments of the company that were underperforming during this time period. Or perhaps one of its competitors had introduced a new product or service that took away some of the company’s business. Because the author leaves so many external variables unaddressed, it is not possible to draw a firm causal connection between the data in the argument.</p>
        <p>When addressing a loss in revenue, a desire to revert to previous structures and strategies is certainly reasonable and oftentimes beneficial. However, the author’s current plan, as based on the given data, suffers from too many flaws to be worthwhile. The existence of so many outside variables calls into question the soundness of the author’s reasoning. Until such variables are addressed, it cannot be established whether the addition of customer support staff will lead to an increase in revenue.</p>
