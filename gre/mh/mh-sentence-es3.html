            <p>23. D and E What potential element of a successful business would “blind” an entrepreneur from attending to the “day-to-day operations of the business”?

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>24. A and C The word in the blank describes what the author’s “flair for the dramatic” has “devolved” into. The describing phrase at the beginning of the sentence serves as a contextual clue by telling us what the novel now features. The combination of the clue at the beginning of the sentence and the word “devolved” tells us that the word in the blank is an extreme version of “dramatic.” A good predictor would be melodramatic. The words that best match melodramatic are maudlin and sentimental. </p>

            <p>25. A and E The word in the blank describes the director’s decision. The contextual clue is the describing phrase after the comma. This phrase clarifies the meaning of the author’s decision. If the decision is “marked by neither consistency nor, apparently, logic,” then a good predictor word would be random. The words that best match random are arbitrary and haphazard. </p>

            <p>26. A and F The word in the blank describes what happened to the actor’s excitement after the discovery. Since he discovered that the role was only for a minor character, something negative must have happened to his excitement. A good prediction here would be decreased. The words that best match decreased are tempered and diminished. </p>

            <p>27. C and E The blank describes the author’s attitude toward violence. The contextual clues are the description that the author is “amicable and inclined toward harmony” and the phrase after the colon that says the “idea of harm inspired a shudder.” A good predictor word to select from these characterizations is avoided. Of the choices, the words closest in meaning to avoided are eschewed and shirked. </p>

            <p>28. A and F The word in the blank explains the relationship between “her belief in his inherent sincerity” and the possibility that “he could sometimes be deceptive.” Since she believed him to be sincere, the possibility of his insincerity must have been nonexistent.

            <p>29. D and F The word in the blank describes “Lakoff’s account of Dostoevsky’s influences.” The clause after the comma explains what will go in the blank. Since Lakoff’s account did not address “Dostoevsky’s concern with the social milieu that he inhabited,” the account must have been limited. Of the choices, the words closest in meaning to limited are insufficient and inadequate. </p>

            <p>30. A and D The word in the blank describes the common misconception about yoga. Since “exaggerating the benefits . . . do nothing to dispel this myth,” the myth must concern an extreme belief about yoga’s benefits. An extreme belief would be the belief that it is a cure-all.
