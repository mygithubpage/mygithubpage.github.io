          <p>Given the reputation that Picasso has attained in Western culture, the lukewarm reactions to his early work, Les Demoiselles d’Avignon were more the exception than the norm.</p>

            <p>11. D and E The blank describes Picasso’s reputation. The logical structure “Given x then y” is a causal clue, indicating that the first part of the sentence will determine the content of the second part of the sentence. If Picasso’s current reputation leads to the conclusion that the lukewarm reactions to his early works were “the exception,” then his reputation must be positive. A good prediction would be celebrated. Of the choices, the words closest in meaning to celebrated are legendary and acclaimed. </p>

            <p>12. B and E The word in the blank will describe the “United States’ increased consumption of self-help books and deference to self-help gurus.” The contrast clue “for” indicates that this description is in spite of the US reputation for selfreliance. To make a prediction, if the United States is known for self-reliance, then its focus on self-help is surprising. Of the choices, the words that most closely match surprising are ironic and unexpected. </p>

            <p>13. A and D The word in the blank describes “any investigation that focuses only on television’s negative impacts on people’s attention spans.” The contextual clue (:) indicates that what comes after the colon will clarify what the author believes about these investigations. To make a prediction: if the investigations provide cultural insights, then ones that focus only on the negative impacts on attention span will be narrow. Of the choices, the words closest in meaning to narrow are shortsighted and limited. </p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>14. A and E The word in the blank describes the boss. The word “notwithstanding” indicates contrast. Thus the description of the boss will contrast with the description of the other employees. If the other employees are amicable, the description of the boss will be the opposite of amicable. Now select your own word. A good word for “opposite of amicable” is unfriendly. The answer choices closest in meaning to unfriendly are cantankerous and frigid. </p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>15. C and D The word in the blank will characterize the accountant. The structure “More x than stingy” implies that the characterization of the accountant will have a different connotation than the word “stingy.” This characterization will match a description of someone who “will willingly spend money.” A good word here would be thrifty. The words closest in meaning to thrifty are frugal and thrifty. (Notice that sometimes the word you predict will show up in the choices!) </p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>16. A and F The word in the blank describes the heroine’s “uncharacteristic” response to the tragedy. The colon is the important contextual clue in the sentence. In this case, what comes after it will clarify how the heroine typically responds. Her typical response is marked by “sentimentality.” Thus her current “uncharacteristic” response will be the opposite of sentimentality. A good predictor is emotionless. The choices closest in meaning to emotionless are stoicism and indifference. </p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>18. A and F The word in the blank will describe the lecturer’s claims. The word “undermined” implies that there is a contrast between the lecturer’s claims and the “authoritativeness” that he projected. The word in the blank should thus be the opposite of what would be expected from someone who projects “authoritativeness.” A good prediction would be shallowness. The words in the choices that best match shallowness are vacuous and superficial. </p>

            <p>19. C and D The word in the blank is a characteristic of the new novel. The phrase “bears little resemblance” indicates that the new novel’s characteristics will be the opposite of those of the original novel. “Subtle” is the opposite of “heavyhanded,” so the word in the blank will be the opposite of “superficiality.” Now choose your own word: a good word would be deep. Of the choices, the words that most closely match deep are profound and probing. </p>

In this case, what comes after the colon will provide a clue for what the description of scientific knowledge will be. Since scientists recognize that their theories will be “supplanted or amended,” the nature of scientific knowledge is that it is changing.
