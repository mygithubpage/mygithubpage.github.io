          <p>One of the key necessities for understanding an organism’s evolutionary history is the identification of the habitats in which the organism’s ancestors thrived. Biologists have developed such techniques as radiocarbon dating and biochronology to date fossils and thereby arrive at an approximate range for an organism’s existence. But knowing that an organism existed during a certain time period says little about the environment that the organism inhabited. Since the earth periodically goes through heating and cooling periods, biologists cannot simply assume that a region’s current climate is the same as it was for, say, a lemur that inhabited that region six million years ago. than oxygen-18, and as global temperatures rise, more oxygen-16 than oxygen-18 evaporates. By studying the fossils of foraminifera, researchers are able to identify the concentrations of these two isotopes at a given time. Researchers can then use the different ratios of the two isotopes during different time periods to make highly educated inferences about the global climate during a specific time period.</p>

            <p><strong>D</strong> The author argues that “these concerns are unfounded” based on the fact that doctors have the ultimate say on whether to prescribe medication to a patient. For this argument to be valid, it must be assumed that the patients seeking inappropriate medications will not be able to convince the doctor to prescribe the unnecessary medications.

            <p><strong>E</strong> The passage’s conclusion is that “fewer students are majoring in business now than they did 20 years ago.” This claim is based on the fact that the <em>percentage</em> of students majoring in business has decreased over the past 20 years. The claim uses a percentage to draw a conclusion about an actual value. If it turns out that the number of students enrolled at these colleges had also increased, then the decrease in the percentage would not necessarily lead to a decrease in the number of students majoring in business.
