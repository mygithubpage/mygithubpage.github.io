            <p>11. E The word in the blank describes what the weather does. The idiom “so . . . that . . .” implies that the feeling of “experiencing winter and summer in the same day” is because of what the weather does. Prediction: if it feels like you’re experiencing different times of year on the same day, then the weather varies. The choice closest in meaning to varies is fluctuates. </p>

            <p>12. A and E There are more clues for the second blank, so start there. The word in the blank describes what the scientists will do once certain conditions about the theory are met. Since gaps must be addressed, once these gaps are addressed, scientists will most likely consider the theory’s plausibility. The choice closest in meaning to consider is entertain. Now look at the first blank. If there are so many gaps that scientists have yet to entertain the theory’s plausibility, then the claim must be far from supported. The choice closest in meaning to supported is substantiated. </p>

            <p>15. A, E, and I There are the most clues for the third blank, so start there. The word in the blank describes a concern that cultural critics have about technology. Thus the word in the blank must be negative. Of the choices, the word with the most clearly negative connotation is alienating. Now look at the second blank.
