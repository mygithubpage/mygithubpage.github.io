C If the “overhaul” will “ameliorate” the situation in the English department, then the English department’s current state must be negative. Prediction: worsening. The choice that best matches worsening is deterioration. </p></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Successful expansion of a business is as much a matter of as of hard work: the greatest work ethic will be useless if it is not performed in the service of a concrete plan.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A foresight</p><p>B persistence</p><p>C insight</p><p>D talent</p><p>E parsimony</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>2. A The word in the blank describes what is necessary for “successful expansion of a business.” The phrase after the colon provides the clue for the blank. The phrase indicates that a concrete plan is necessary. Thus a good prediction would be a word that deals with developing a plan: planning. The word that best matches planning is foresight. </p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Despite its obvious flaws, the economist’s plan to increase employment found many , mostly because a better alternative did not seem feasible.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A detractors</p><p>B confounders</p><p>C proponents</p><p>D derivatives</p><p>E expungers</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>3. C The word in the blank describes the people reacting to the economist’s plan. The contextual clue “despite” indicates that the plan’s reception was in contrast to what would be expected from a plan with “flaws.” A good prediction would be supporters. The word that best matches supporters is proponents. </p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The inherent of David Foster Wallace’s novels is apparent in the proliferation of guides and supplements to his novels.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A density</p><p>B beauty</p><p>C aesthetics</p><p>D unconventionality</p><p>E misanthropy</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>4. A The word in the blank describes David Foster Wallace’s novels. The word “apparent” indicates that the many “guides and supplements” is a clue to the description of his novels. If his novels have given rise to guides and supplements, then they must be difficult. The word in the choices that most closely matches difficult is density. </p></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The novelist’s tone puzzled readers expecting the straightforward and terse prose that characterized his previous works.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A philosophical</p><p>B meandering</p><p>C jovial</p><p>D progressive</p><p>E melancholy</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>5. B The word in the blank describes the novelist’s tone. Since this tone “puzzled” readers of his previous works, it must be different from the tone of his previous works. If his previous works were “straightforward and terse,” then his new work must be the opposite of “straightforward and terse.” A good prediction is long-winded. The word among the choices that most closely matches long-winded is meandering. </p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The belief that professional athletes can become financially after signing lucrative contracts motivated the league’s commissioner to institute a mandatory financial-planning course.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A enthusiastic</p><p>B haughty</p><p>C reckless</p><p>D opulent</p><p>E diminutive </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="C"><p>6. C The word in the blank describes what can happen to athletes after they sign “lucrative contracts.” This belief explains why the commissioner “institute[d] a mandatory financial-planning course.” The most likely reason the commissioner instituted such a course is that the athletes are financially irresponsible with their money. The word in the choices that best matches irresponsible is reckless. </p></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The discovery that the brain’s connections can change even during old age previous beliefs that the basic configuration of the brain is fixed by middle age.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A undermined</p><p>B highlighted</p><p>C determined</p><p>D implied</p><p>E validated</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>7. A The discovery in the first part of the sentence is in contrast to “previous beliefs” about the brain. Prediction: What did this discovery do to previous beliefs? A good word is overthrew. The word in the choices that best matches overthrew is undermined. </p></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The politician’s newly developed tendency to (i) underrepresented groups surprised colleagues who remembered him as (ii) these groups’ economic plight. </p></div><div class="choices"><p>A sympathize with</p><p>B mimic</p><p>C deride</p></div><div class="choices"><p>D curious about</p><p>E indifferent to</p><p>F hopeful for</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AE"><p>8. A and E Since the politician’s current behavior “surprises” colleagues, the word in the first blank and second blanks should convey opposing attitudes toward “underrepresented groups.” </p></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>By adopting a(n) (i) tone in lieu of a more moderate one, the author produces arguments based more on (ii) than sound reasoning. </p></div><div class="choices"><p>A incendiary</p><p>B well-reasoned</p><p>C conservative</p></div><div class="choices"><p>D rhetoric</p><p>E displacement</p><p>F analysis </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>9. A and D The easier blank to address in this sentence is the first. “In lieu of” indicates contrast, so the author’s tone is in contrast to “moderate.” A good prediction is extreme. Of the choices in Column 1, the word closest in meaning to extreme is incendiary. Now, substitute incendiary into the first blank and solve for the second blank. The argument’s content is in contrast to “sound reasoning.” Thus it must be without substance. A good prediction is style. The word in the choices that best matches style is rhetoric.
            </p></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>Greene’s discussion of the nuances of particle physics, though seemingly (i), actually serves a purpose. Indeed, without this background, the reader would be unable to (ii) the significance of the evidence presented later in the book. </p></div><div class="choices"><p>A incomprehensible</p><p>B tangential</p><p>C deliberate</p></div><div class="choices"><p>D obstruct</p><p>E synthesize</p><p>F appreciate</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BF"><p>10. B and F The first blank is simpler, so start there. The first blank describes a false view of “Greene’s discussion of the nuances of particle physics.” The discussion “served a purpose,” so since the word in the blank comes after “though,” it should convey a meaning opposite of serving a purpose. A good prediction is irrelevant. In Column 1, the closest word to irrelevant is tangential. The second blank describes why a reader needs this information. Since the information “served a purpose,” the reader must need it to understand the evidence. In Column 2, the closest word to understand is appreciate.
            </p></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>It is a common that most scientific discoveries are simply moments of genius: in fact, the discoveries we hear of usually take years of painstaking work.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A myth</p><p>B verity</p><p>C curiosity</p><p>D misconception</p><p>E trope</p><p>F theme</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>1. A and D The word in the blank describes common beliefs about scientific discoveries. The contextual clue is “in fact,” which indicates that the following clause is in contrast to what is currently believed about scientific discoveries. If the discoveries actually “take years of painstaking work,” then the common belief is wrong. A good prediction for the blank would be false belief. Of the choices, the words that most closely match false belief are myth and misconception. </p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Success in this business requires constant of one’s reputation, since even one negative perception can often undo years of hard work.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A neglect of</p><p>B knowledge of</p><p>C curiosity about</p><p>D monitoring of</p><p>E oversight of</p><p>F consideration of</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="DE"><p>2. D and E The word in the blank describes what is necessary to ensure “success in this business.” The contextual clue is the causal clue “since.” If “one negative perception can often undo years of hard work,” then a business would need to maintain its reputation. The words that most closely match maintain are monitoring and oversight. </p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>That she was occasionally late to class did not concern the professor; instead, it was only when her tardiness became that the professor decided to chastise her.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A well-known</p><p>B offensive</p><p>C habitual</p><p>D sensitive</p><p>E commonplace</p><p>F infrequent </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CE"><p>3. C and E The word in the blank describes the level of tardiness that caused the professor to chastise the student. The contextual clue “instead” indicates contrast. When the student was “occasionally late,” it did not bother the professor. The word in the blank should thus be the opposite of “occasional.” A good prediction would be constant. The choices that best match constant are habitual and commonplace. </p></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Even in football, where violence is considered part of the game, the player’s brutish playing style was .</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A contrived</p><p>B excessive</p><p>C overlooked</p><p>D gratuitous</p><p>E ambivalent</p><p>F forsaken</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>4. B and D The word in the blank describes the player’s “brutish playing style.” The contextual clue “even” indicates that the player’s style was extreme for football. Since “violence is considered part of the game,” and the player’s style was extreme, a good prediction would be overboard. The choices that best match overboard are excessive and gratuitous. </p></div></div><div id="question15" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The character’s trademark cynicism was evident in his obvious the loving couple.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A disdain for</p><p>B contempt for</p><p>C enthrallment with</p><p>D amusement at</p><p>E encouragement of</p><p>F sensitivity to</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AB"><p>5. A and B The word in the blank describes the character’s attitude toward the “loving couple.” Since the character is “cynical,” his attitude toward the couple would most likely be negative. A good prediction would be distaste for. The words in the choice that most closely match distaste for are disdain for and contempt for. </p></div></div><div id="question16" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Despite the website’s large audience, financially minded critics have been skeptical of the website’s ability to this popularity.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A understand</p><p>B develop</p><p>C monetize</p><p>D undermine</p><p>E capitalize on</p><p>F elicit</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CE"><p>6. C and E The word in the blank tells us what the “financially minded critics have been skeptical” of. The contrast signal “Despite” indicates that their skepticism contrasts with the popularity of the website. If the critics are financially minded, then they would most likely be skeptical of the website’s ability to make money. A good prediction would be take advantage of. The choices that best match take advantage of are monetize and capitalize on. </p></div></div><div id="question17" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Because it prioritizes theory over evidence, serious philosophical thinking takes empirical support as irrelevant, or at least, .</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A tangential</p><p>B mitigating</p><p>C amorphous</p><p>D inconsequential</p><p>E disparaging</p><p>F intellectual</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>7. A and D The word in the blank describes the attitude that philosophical thinking takes toward empirical support. The contextual clue “or at least” indicates that this attitude is similar to the belief that “takes empirical support as irrelevant.” A good prediction would be a synonym of “irrelevant”: unimportant. The words in the choices that most match unimportant are tangential and inconsequential. </p></div></div><div id="question18" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Supporters of the company believe that its negative valuation is the founders’ often childish behavior rather than the company’s merits as a sustainable business.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A attributable to</p><p>B a consequence of</p><p>C preceded by</p><p>D obscured by</p><p>E eliminated by</p><p>F despite</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AB"><p>8. A and B The word in the blank describes the company’s negative valuation. The contextual clue “rather” indicates contrast. Supporters of the company believe that the company is worthwhile, so they most likely have a positive view of the company. Thus they do not think the merits of the company explain its negative valuation. To predict a word we can conclude that the supporters assign the negative valuation to the behavior of the founders instead of to the company itself. Of the choices, the words that best match assign are attributable to and a consequence of. </p></div></div><div id="question19" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The belief that the increasing use of electronic elements in music detracts from the artistic value of that music is flawed as such a view the aesthetic abilities necessary to use electronics effectively.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A emphasizes</p><p>B determines</p><p>C trivializes</p><p>D neglects</p><p>E underscores</p><p>F undermines </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CD"><p>9. C and D The contextual clue “as” indicates that the word in the blank will explain why the belief in the first part of the sentence is flawed. If “the belief that the increasing use of electronic elements in music detracts from the artistic value of that music is flawed,” then the view most likely ignores the aesthetic abilities displayed by that music. Of the choices, the words that most closely match ignores are neglects and trivializes. The correct answer is C and D. </p></div></div><div id="question20" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Far from being dejected by the setback, the employee used the challenge as motivation to work even harder.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A tenacious</p><p>B ambivalent</p><p>C plucky</p><p>D circumspect</p><p>E morose</p><p>F understated </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>10. A and C The word in the blank describes the employee. The contrast clue “far from” indicates that the employee behaved in a manner that contrasts with the way someone “discouraged” behaves. A good prediction would be persistent. The words that most closely match persistent are tenacious and plucky.
            </p></div></div><div id="passage1" class="passage"><p>When Tocqueville came to America in 1831, he expressed a sentiment that is echoed in the works of Bloom and Kennedy: that American democracy, by encouraging dissent, can lead to its own undoing. But in contrast to the pessimism that dominates Bloom’s and Kennedy’s thinking, Tocqueville’s analysis went a step further. While acknowledging the seeming inevitability of dissent among the citizenry, he also recognized that beneath this frustration there lay a fundamental belief that democratic politics would ultimately amend the situations that aroused complaint. As Tocqueville noted, at any given point in time democracy can appear chaotic, shallow, and contradictory. But, he noted, it was never stagnant. For Tocqueville, democracy’s tendency to encourage and accommodate discontent was its greatest virtue. Because it is self-correcting, a properly run democratic system would ultimately benefit from any discontent because the system is designed to rectify the problem.</p></div><div id="question21" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage1"><div class="question">The author mentions Tocqueville’s belief that democracy “was never stagnant” to</div><div class="choices"><p>A highlight Tocqueville’s belief in the self-correcting nature of democracy</p><p>B introduce a difference between Tocqueville’s thinking and that of Bloom and Kennedy</p><p>C explain why Tocqueville believes citizens of democratic nations are often upset</p><p>D suggest ways to eliminate the frustration of the citizens of democratic nations</p><p>E imply that many of the concerns of democratic citizens are baseless</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>1. A The author uses this line when elaborating on Tocqueville’s argument that democracy would benefit from dissent. Tocqueville believed that democracy could tolerate and benefit from dissent because it is self-correcting. The fact that it is “never stagnant” is in support of its self-correcting nature. </p></div></div><div id="question22" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage1"><div class="question">It can be inferred from the passage that Tocqueville agrees with Bloom and Kennedy about which of the following?</div><div class="choices"><p>A Democracy is the ideal form of government.</p><p>B Discontent is inherent in any democracy.</p><p>C Democracy can only function when its citizens express concern over important issues.</p><p>D Democracy’s greatest virtue is its adaptability.</p><p>E If not properly run, democracy can undermine itself. </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>2. B All three authors agree that there will be dissent in a democracy. However, they disagree on the consequences of this dissent. </p></div></div><div id="passage2" class="passage"><p>Lucian Freud famously remarked that anything he might say about his art is as relevant to the art as the noise a tennis player emits when hitting a ball. Freud presented this analogy as a way of capturing his belief about the relationship between artist and art: It is the art that lends significance to the artist, and not the other way around. Such a view, while unorthodox for any epoch, was especially so for the time period in which Freud created his major works. In the 20th-century, the lines between art and consumer culture became blurred, and selfpromotion became de rigueur for most major artists of the period. Freud’s tendency to deflect attention is not, as some commentators have stated, wholly a by-product of a desire to prevent encroachments into his personal life. Rather, it is predominantly a function of his deep-seated belief that if one’s art is given a place of prominence, the careful critic will be able to discern the thought processes and motivations of the artist.</p></div><div id="question23" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question">Which of the following situations is most in line with Freud’s belief about “the relationship between artist and art”?</div><div class="choices"><p>A A sculptor who refuses to be interviewed because she values her anonymity.</p><p>B A potter who refers to her creations when asked personal questions.</p><p>C A muralist who uses scenes from her own life in her creations.</p><p>D A composer who acknowledges others’ influences on her compositions.</p><p>E A novelist who writes novels that take place several centuries ago.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="0"><p>2. 10. B Freud believes that “it is the art that lends significance to the artist, and not the other way around.” He uses this fact as justification for giving his art prominence over his personal life. The situation that most closely matches the this notion is Choice B. </p></div></div><div id="question24" data-choice-type="checkbox" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question">The information in the passage supports which of the following as reasons for Freud’s rejection of self-promoting techniques?</div><div class="choices"><p>A A desire to maintain his privacy</p><p>B A desire to rebel against what was considered conventional behavior of 20th-century artists</p><p>C The belief that the art held more significance than the artist who created it</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AC"><p>11. A and C Choice A: The author states “Freud’s tendency to deflect attention is not, as some commentators have stated, wholly a by-product of a desire to prevent encroachments into his personal life.” The use of the word “wholly” implies that his rejection of self-promotion is somewhat motivated by a desire to maintain his privacy. Thus Choice A is correct. Choice B: Though Freud’s beliefs about art were unorthodox for a 20th-century artist, nothing in the passage suggests that a desire to be unorthodox motivated his rejection of self-promotion. Thus Choice B is incorrect. Choice C: The passage implies that Freud rejected self-promotion because he wanted to give his art “a place of prominence.” Thus Choice C is correct. </p></div></div><div id="passage3" class="passage"><p>Gorland is considering a law that will allow the advertising of prescription medications. Critics of the practice worry that people who see these advertisements will seek out inappropriate prescriptions and thereby endanger their health. However, advertisers believe that since doctors ultimately decide whether to prescribe a given medication to a patient, these concerns are unfounded. </p></div><div id="question25" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage3"><div class="question">In responding to the critics’ concerns, which of the following is an assumption that the advertisers must make?</div><div class="choices"><p>A The majority of people seeking medical care have seen advertisements for prescriptions.</p><p>B The advertisements for prescription medications are designed to deceive consumers.</p><p>C People seeking health care often attempt to diagnose themselves before seeing a doctor.</p><p>D Doctors will not be swayed by patients seeking inappropriate prescriptions.</p><p>E Not all doctor visits are for the purpose of obtaining medication. </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>12. D The author argues that “these concerns are unfounded” based on the fact that doctors have the ultimate say on whether to prescribe medication to a patient. For this argument to be valid, it must be assumed that the patients seeking inappropriate medications will not be able to convince the doctor to prescribe the unnecessary medications. If these patients were able to convince the doctor, then even though the doctor has the ultimate say, the critics’ concerns would be legitimate. </p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
