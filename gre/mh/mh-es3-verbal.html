The ascent of European civilization and its conquest of other cultures is not a result of some sort of inborn superiority on the part of the European conquerors. Rather, this cultural “success” is attributable to the confluence of favorable environmental conditions and fortuitous cultural events. Or so argues Diamond, in his wellreceived analysis of the Western world’s rise to dominance.</p><p>Diamond provides a wealth of data to support his point. Citing variables as varied as the mineral composition of a local region, fluctuations in weather, and access to docile animals, he argues that the development and evolution of any civilization is contingent on external variables. Since these variables are inherently uncontrollable, the civilizations for which these factors were aligned favorably were the ones that were most likely to thrive. Though Diamond’s use of detailed evidence is refreshing, and his ability to use such disparate information to draw broad conclusions is creative, it is the sweeping nature of his conclusions that makes his argument problematic. The very act of making inferences about local environments thousands of years ago is fraught with the potential for error, but Diamond gives little weight to these concerns. Indeed, by placing excessive emphasis on this data, he paints a simplistic portrait of the past 13,000 years of human history that only passingly acknowledges the roles of the individual human actors and their cultures. Paradoxically, in rightfully trying to debunk myths about Eurasian supremacy, Diamond marginalizes the cultures that he is attempting to defend.</p></div><div id="question21" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage1"><div class="question">The author of the passage is primarily concerned with</div><div class="choices"><p>A highlighting the importance of certain cultural trends</p><p>B introducing and evaluating a theory about why civilizations thrive</p><p>C explaining the role of data in making predictions</p><p>D discussing the factors that shape the evolution of a civilization</p><p>E analyzing the critical reception of a recent theory </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>6.

D The author uses the word “fraught” in reference to what the author believes is an erroneous assumption made by Diamond.

A First, identify what is unexpected about the situation. Sepoma’s revenues decreased even though sales of its furniture increased. How could this be the case? Sepoma must have sources of revenue other than its own furniture. Choice A is the correct answer because it shows that Sepoma makes money by selling parts to other manufacturers. If the revenue for the furniture of those other manufacturers decreased, then Sepoma’s revenue would have decreased as well.
