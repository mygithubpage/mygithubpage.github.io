            <p>22. A and F There are more clues for the first blank, so start there. The word in the first blank indicates the approach that the scientist did not take. The contextual clue “instead of” indicates that the scientist did not simply observe and characterize what he saw. If he did not simply observe and characterize, then what did he lack? A good prediction would be objectivity. Of the choices, the word closest in meaning to objectivity is disinterest. Now look at the second blank. The word in the second blank tells us what the scientist did “instead of simply observing and characterizing the phenomena.” A good prediction is manipulated.

            <p>23. A and E Start with the first blank. If the distinction is between the blank and “obsession,” Emerson must view moderate amounts of the blank favorably. The second sentence says that Emerson believed “the scholarly life afforded its adherents a fresh perspective,” so he must have a favorable view of scholarliness. Of the choices, the word that most closely matches scholarliness is erudition. Now look at the second blank. If Emerson “emphasized the distinction between erudition and obsession,” then he warned against becoming obsessed with the pursuit.

            <p>26. A, D, and H The easiest blank to start with is the first. If “no one made explicit mention of” the leadership hierarchy, then the agreement must have been unspoken. Of the choices, the word closest in meaning to unspoken is tacit. The next easiest blank is the third blank. If Johnson “was best-suited to head the numbers-based project,” then he must have been adept at math. A good prediction would be aptitude.

            <p>27. A and F Start with the second blank. The contextual clue “in favor of” indicates that Poincaré preferred “the precision of mathematical concepts” to “ human engagement.” A good prediction for the second blank is: bypassed. Of the choices, the word closest in meaning to bypassed is forsook. Now look at the first blank. If he forsook human engagement, then what kind of existence did he lead?
