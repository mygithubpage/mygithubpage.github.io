            <p>18. A and F The word in the blank will describe the lecturer’s claims. The word “undermined” implies that there is a contrast between the lecturer’s claims and the “authoritativeness” that he projected. The word in the blank should thus be the opposite of what would be expected from someone who projects “authoritativeness.” A good prediction would be shallowness. The words in the choices that best match shallowness are vacuous and superficial. </p>

            <p>19. C and D The word in the blank is a characteristic of the new novel. The phrase “bears little resemblance” indicates that the new novel’s characteristics will be the opposite of those of the original novel. “Subtle” is the opposite of “heavyhanded,” so the word in the blank will be the opposite of “superficiality.” Now choose your own word: a good word would be deep. Of the choices, the words that most closely match deep are profound and probing. </p>

            <p>20. A and E The word in the blank will describe “scientific knowledge.” The contextual clue in the sentence is the colon. What comes after it will clarify what was stated before it. In this case, what comes after the colon will provide a clue for what the description of scientific knowledge will be. Since scientists recognize that their theories will be “supplanted or amended,” the nature of scientific knowledge is that it is changing. The words in the choices that best match changing are fluid and dynamic. </p>
