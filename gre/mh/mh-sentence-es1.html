            <p>1. A and D The word in the blank describes common beliefs about scientific discoveries. The contextual clue is “in fact,” which indicates that the following clause is in contrast to what is currently believed about scientific discoveries. If the discoveries actually “take years of painstaking work,” then the common belief is wrong. A good prediction for the blank would be false belief. Of the choices, the words that most closely match false belief are myth and misconception. </p>

            <p>2. D and E The word in the blank describes what is necessary to ensure “success in this business.” The contextual clue is the causal clue “since.” If “one negative perception can often undo years of hard work,” then a business would need to maintain its reputation. The words that most closely match maintain are monitoring and oversight. </p>

            <p>3. C and E The word in the blank describes the level of tardiness that caused the professor to chastise the student. The contextual clue “instead” indicates contrast. When the student was “occasionally late,” it did not bother the professor. The word in the blank should thus be the opposite of “occasional.” A good prediction would be constant. The choices that best match constant are habitual and commonplace. </p>

            <p>4. B and D The word in the blank describes the player’s “brutish playing style.” The contextual clue “even” indicates that the player’s style was extreme for football. Since “violence is considered part of the game,” and the player’s style was extreme, a good prediction would be overboard. The choices that best match overboard are excessive and gratuitous. </p>

            <p>5. A and B The word in the blank describes the character’s attitude toward the “loving couple.” Since the character is “cynical,” his attitude toward the couple would most likely be negative. A good prediction would be distaste for. The words in the choice that most closely match distaste for are disdain for and contempt for. </p>

            <p>6. C and E The word in the blank tells us what the “financially minded critics have been skeptical” of. The contrast signal “Despite” indicates that their skepticism contrasts with the popularity of the website. If the critics are financially minded, then they would most likely be skeptical of the website’s ability to make money. A good prediction would be take advantage of. The choices that best match take advantage of are monetize and capitalize on. </p>

            <p>7. A and D The word in the blank describes the attitude that philosophical thinking takes toward empirical support. The contextual clue “or at least” indicates that this attitude is similar to the belief that “takes empirical support as irrelevant.” A good prediction would be a synonym of “irrelevant”: unimportant. The words in the choices that most match unimportant are tangential and inconsequential. </p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>8. A and B The word in the blank describes the company’s negative valuation. The contextual clue “rather” indicates contrast. Supporters of the company believe that the company is worthwhile, so they most likely have a positive view of the company. Thus they do not think the merits of the company explain its negative valuation. To predict a word we can conclude that the supporters assign the negative valuation to the behavior of the founders instead of to the company itself. Of the choices, the words that best match assign are attributable to and a consequence of. </p>

            <p>9. C and D The contextual clue “as” indicates that the word in the blank will explain why the belief in the first part of the sentence is flawed. If “the belief that the increasing use of electronic elements in music detracts from the artistic value of that music is flawed,” then the view most likely ignores the aesthetic abilities displayed by that music. Of the choices, the words that most closely match ignores are neglects and trivializes. The correct answer is C and D. </p>

The words that most closely match persistent are tenacious and plucky.
