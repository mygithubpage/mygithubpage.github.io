            <p>9. A and D The easier blank to address in this sentence is the first. “In lieu of” indicates contrast, so the author’s tone is in contrast to “moderate.” A good prediction is extreme.

The argument’s content is in contrast to “sound reasoning.” Thus it must be without substance. A good prediction is style. The word in the choices that best matches style is rhetoric.

The first blank describes a false view of “Greene’s discussion of the nuances of particle physics.” The discussion “served a purpose,” so since the word in the blank comes after “though,” it should convey a meaning opposite of serving a purpose. A good prediction is irrelevant. In Column 1, the closest word to irrelevant is tangential. The second blank describes why a reader needs this information. Since the information “served a purpose,” the reader must need it to understand the evidence. In Column 2, the closest word to understand is appreciate.
