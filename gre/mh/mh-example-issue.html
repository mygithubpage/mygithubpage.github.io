        <p>With society’s increasing emphasis and glorification of celebrity culture, it has become commonplace to regard this attention with suspicion and sometimes even downright derision. The constant barrage of reality TV shows has made everyone skeptical of the actual value that celebrity culture provides to society and has caused many critics to lament what they believe is the deterioration of American cultural life. Nonetheless, despite some apparent drawbacks of the attention that we give celebrities, this behavior has numerous benefits to our society. Specifically, the attention we give celebrities increases our awareness of societal problems, gives a large audience to important issues, and helps us learn from the publicized mistakes of celebrities.</p>
        <p>The attention our culture gives celebrities often highlights causes that society at large might otherwise be unaware of. For example, Angelina Jolie’s numerous trips to malnourished villages in Africa have been highly publicized by the news media. When this actress makes these trips, she focuses on the chronic impoverishment of these countries and the absence of many basic necessities that we take for granted in the Western world, such as readily available food, lodging, and sanitation. Because Jolie is so famous and her travels receive so much attention, the problems in these countries are broadcast to a wider audience than they would be through just a late-night infomercial or news segment. Thus it is evident that Jolie’s fame has had a positive impact on society. She has used the constant attention from the media to bring awareness to an important social issue that might otherwise have gone ignored by much of Western society. And though the problems that she addresses have certainly not been eradicated, her focus on them has put society in a better position to address some of the world’s inequalities.</p>
        <p>The examples illustrate the beneficial effects that our attention to celebrities can provide society. Because news and media coverage are so pervasive in our lives, and because these outlets so often cover celebrity life, celebrities can often use these outlets to advance social and cultural causes that the general population might otherwise neglect. Though many worry that the development of social media and the proliferation of celebrity websites have made celebrities into only a spectacle, the point still stands that celebrities can leverage their popularity to achieve goals that supersede their immediate self-interest and benefit society as a whole.</p>
