          <p>A detailed look into the past 13,000 years of human history reveals an important trend. The ascent of European civilization and its conquest of other cultures is not a result of some sort of inborn superiority on the part of the European conquerors. Rather, this cultural “success” is attributable to the confluence of favorable environmental conditions and fortuitous cultural events. Or so argues Diamond, in his well-received analysis of the Western world’s rise to dominance. fluctuations in weather, and access to docile animals, he argues that the development and evolution of any civilization is contingent on external variables. Since these variables are inherently uncontrollable, the civilizations for which these factors were aligned favorably were the ones that were most likely to thrive. Though Diamond’s use of detailed evidence is refreshing, and his ability to use such disparate information to draw broad conclusions is creative, it is the sweeping nature of his conclusions that makes his argument problematic. The very act of making inferences about local environments thousands of years ago is fraught with the potential for error, but Diamond gives little weight to these concerns. Indeed, by placing excessive emphasis on this data, he paints a simplistic portrait of the past 13,000 years of human history that only passingly acknowledges the roles of the individual human actors and their cultures. Paradoxically, in rightfully trying to debunk myths about Eurasian supremacy, Diamond marginalizes the cultures that he is attempting to defend.</p>
