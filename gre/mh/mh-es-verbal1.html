            <p><strong>A</strong> The author uses this line when elaborating on Tocqueville’s argument that democracy would benefit from dissent. Tocqueville believed that democracy could tolerate and benefit from dissent because it is self-correcting. The fact that it is “never stagnant” is in support of its self-correcting nature.</p>

          <p>When Tocqueville came to America in 1831, he expressed a sentiment that is echoed in the works of Bloom and Kennedy: that American democracy, by encouraging dissent, can lead to its own undoing. But in contrast to the pessimism that dominates Bloom’s and Kennedy’s thinking, Tocqueville’s analysis went a step further. While acknowledging the seeming inevitability of dissent among the citizenry, he also recognized that beneath this frustration there lay a fundamental belief that democratic politics would ultimately amend the situations that aroused complaint. As Tocqueville noted, at any given point in time democracy can appear chaotic, shallow, and contradictory. But, he noted, it was never stagnant. For Tocqueville, democracy’s tendency to encourage and accommodate discontent was its greatest virtue. Because it is self-correcting, a properly run democratic system would ultimately benefit from any discontent because the system is designed to rectify the problem.</p>

            <p><strong>B</strong> Freud believes that “it is the art that lends significance to the artist, and not the other way around.” He uses this fact as justification for giving his art prominence over his personal life.

        <div id="passage2" class="passage">
          <p>Lucian Freud famously remarked that anything he might say about his art is as relevant to the art as the noise a tennis player emits when hitting a ball. Freud presented this analogy as a way of capturing his belief about the relationship between artist and art: It is the art that lends significance to the artist, and not the other way around. Such a view, while unorthodox for any epoch, was especially so for the time period in which Freud created his major works. In the 20th-century, the lines between art and consumer culture became blurred, and self-promotion became <em>de rigueur</em> for most major artists of the period. Freud’s tendency to deflect attention is not, as some commentators have stated, wholly a by-product of a desire to prevent encroachments into his personal life. Rather, it is predominantly a function of his deep-seated belief that if one’s art is given a place of prominence, the careful critic will be able to discern the thought processes and motivations of the artist.</p>

            <p><strong>A and C</strong>

            <p><strong>Choice A:</strong> The author states “Freud’s tendency to deflect attention is not, as some commentators have stated, wholly a by-product of a desire to prevent encroachments into his personal life.” The use of the word “wholly” implies that his rejection of self-promotion is <em>somewhat</em> motivated by a desire to maintain his privacy. Thus Choice A is correct.</p>
            <p><strong>Choice B:</strong> Though Freud’s beliefs about art were unorthodox for a 20th-century artist, nothing in the passage suggests that a desire to be unorthodox motivated his rejection of self-promotion. Thus Choice B is incorrect.</p>
            <p><strong>Choice C:</strong> The passage implies that Freud rejected self-promotion because he wanted to give his art “a place of prominence.” Thus Choice C is correct.</p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> First, identify what is unexpected about the situation. Sepoma’s revenues decreased even though sales of its furniture increased. How could this be the case? Sepoma must have sources of revenue other than its own furniture. Choice A is the correct answer because it shows that Sepoma makes money by selling parts to other manufacturers. If the revenue for the furniture of those other manufacturers decreased, then Sepoma’s revenue would have decreased as well.</p>
