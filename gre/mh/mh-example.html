When Tocqueville came to America in 1831, he expressed a sentiment that is echoed in the works of Bloom and Kennedy: that American democracy, by encouraging dissent, can lead to its own undoing. But in contrast to the pessimism that dominates Bloom’s and Kennedy’s thinking, Tocqueville’s analysis went a step further. While acknowledging the seeming inevitability of dissent among the citizenry, he also recognized that beneath this frustration there lay a fundamental belief that democratic politics would ultimately amend the situations that aroused complaint. As Tocqueville noted, at any given point in time, democracy can appear chaotic, shallow, and contradictory. But, he noted, it was never stagnant. For Tocqueville, democracy’s tendency to encourage and accommodate discontent was its greatest virtue. Because it is self-correcting, a properly run democratic system would ultimately benefit from any discontent because the system is designed to ultimately rectify the problem.
The author mentions Tocqueville’s belief that democracy “was never stagnant” to A highlight Tocqueville’s belief in the self-correcting nature of democracy B introduce a difference between Tocqueville’s thinking and that of Bloom and Kennedy C explain why Tocqueville believes citizens of democratic nations are often unhappy D suggest ways to eliminate the frustration of the citizens of democratic nations E imply that many of the concerns of democratic citizens are baseless
SOLUTION: The author provides this statement to support the larger point that democracies can withstand turmoil because they are designed to correct themselves. The correct answer is A.

Due to an insatiable , the business executive felt no qualms about employing unethical means to generate profits. A benevolence B curiosity C ambiguity D deliberateness E avarice
Step 1: Identify the Contextual Clue In the previous sentence, the phrase “due to” is a cause-effect signal.
Step 2: Determine the Contextual Clue’s Relationship with the Rest of the Sentence Determine the relationship that the contextual clue creates between the blank and the different parts of the sentence. In the example, the phrase “due to” indicates that the word in the blank will characterize someone willing to pursue unethical means to generate profits.

Step 4: Select the Answer That Best Matches Your Prediction Among the five choices, the closest synonym for greed is avarice. The correct answer is E.

The writer’s deft mastery of the novelistic form was not, as commonly thought, a function of (i) : he spent years (ii)  his skills until his previous weaknesses became applauded virtues.
Blank (i) Blank (ii) A innate abilities D genuflecting B artistic sensibilities E honing C overarching perspicacity F deriding
To determine the word for the second blank, you can use the process outlined earlier. The contextual clue “until” indicates that the writer did something to his skills to change them from “weaknesses” to “virtues.” Now make your prediction. If the writer made weaknesses into virtues, then he probably refined his weaknesses. Now find the word in the choices that most closely matches refined. Of the choices, the word that most closely matches refined is honing. Thus the correct answer for the second blank is E. Now to determine the word for the first blank, assume that honing is in the second place, and go through the same process as before. The word in the blank refers to an erroneous belief about the author’s “mastery of the novelistic form.” If the writer “spent years honing his skills,” then the talent took time to develop. It would thus be erroneous to believe that the talents were based on “instinct.” Of the choices, the phrase that most closely matches “instinct” is innate abilities. The correct choice for the first blank is A.
 
Despite their obvious hostility toward each other, the two teammates remained silent on the issue since they both believed that verbalizing these feelings would undermine the  necessary for the team’s longterm success. A harmony B imbalance C malevolence D tacitness E cooperation F diligence
The causal word “since” indicates that the teammates’ feelings about verbalizing their feelings explains why they remained silent. You know that the feelings were “hostile” and the teammates were afraid that these feelings would “undermine” something necessary for the team’s success. So to make the prediction, ask the following question: What component of team success would “hostile” feelings most likely “undermine”? A good prediction is unity. Now look at the choices, and find the two words closest in meaning to unity. The best choices are harmony and cooperation. The correct answer is A and E.

2. Success in this business requires constant of one’s reputation, since even one negative perception can often. A determined B morose C dejected D apathetic E exaggerated F motivated
Since determined and motivated have similar meanings, you can keep A and F.  Since morose and dejected have similar meanings, you can keep C and D. But notice that there is no synonym for apathetic and no synonym for exaggerated. Thus without even seeing the sentence, you can eliminate choices D and E! This strategy could have helped you in the original question in this section. Perhaps you chose diligence as one of your answers. However, if you look back at the choices, you’ll notice that there are no synonyms for diligence. Thus diligence could not have been correct.
