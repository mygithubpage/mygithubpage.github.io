            <p>1. C If the “overhaul” will “ameliorate” the situation in the English department, then the English department’s current state must be negative. Prediction: worsening. The choice that best matches worsening is deterioration. </p>

            <p>2. A The word in the blank describes what is necessary for “successful expansion of a business.” The phrase after the colon provides the clue for the blank. The phrase indicates that a concrete plan is necessary. Thus a good prediction would be a word that deals with developing a plan: planning. The word that best matches planning is foresight. </p>

            <p>4. A The word in the blank describes David Foster Wallace’s novels. The word “apparent” indicates that the many “guides and supplements” is a clue to the description of his novels. If his novels have given rise to guides and supplements, then they must be difficult. The word in the choices that most closely matches difficult is density. </p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>5. B The word in the blank describes the novelist’s tone. Since this tone “puzzled” readers of his previous works, it must be different from the tone of his previous works. If his previous works were “straightforward and terse,” then his new work must be the opposite of “straightforward and terse.” A good prediction is long-winded. The word among the choices that most closely matches long-winded is meandering. </p>

            <p>6. C The word in the blank describes what can happen to athletes after they sign “lucrative contracts.” This belief explains why the commissioner “institute[d] a mandatory financial-planning course.” The most likely reason the commissioner instituted such a course is that the athletes are financially irresponsible with their money. The word in the choices that best matches irresponsible is reckless. </p>

            <p>9. A and D The easier blank to address in this sentence is the first. “In lieu of” indicates contrast, so the author’s tone is in contrast to “moderate.” A good prediction is extreme. Of the choices in Column 1, the word closest in meaning to extreme is incendiary. Now, substitute incendiary into the first blank and solve for the second blank. The argument’s content is in contrast to “sound reasoning.” Thus it must be without substance. A good prediction is style. The word in the choices that best matches style is rhetoric.

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>10. B and F The first blank is simpler, so start there. The first blank describes a false view of “Greene’s discussion of the nuances of particle physics.” The discussion “served a purpose,” so since the word in the blank comes after “though,” it should convey a meaning opposite of serving a purpose. A good prediction is irrelevant. In Column 1, the closest word to irrelevant is tangential. The second blank describes why a reader needs this information. Since the information “served a purpose,” the reader must need it to understand the evidence. In Column 2, the closest word to understand is appreciate.
