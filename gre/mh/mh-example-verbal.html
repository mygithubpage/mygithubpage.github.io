        <p>When Tocqueville came to America in 1831, he expressed a sentiment that is echoed in the works of Bloom and Kennedy: that American democracy, by encouraging dissent, can lead to its own undoing. But in contrast to the pessimism that dominates Bloom’s and Kennedy’s thinking, Tocqueville’s analysis went a step further. While acknowledging the seeming inevitability of dissent among the citizenry, he also recognized that beneath this frustration there lay a fundamental belief that democratic politics would ultimately amend the situations that aroused complaint. As Tocqueville noted, at any given point in time, democracy can appear chaotic, shallow, and contradictory. But, he noted, it was never stagnant. For Tocqueville, democracy’s tendency to encourage and accommodate discontent was its greatest virtue. Because it is self-correcting, a properly run democratic system would ultimately benefit from any discontent because the system is designed to ultimately rectify the problem.</p>

Step 2: Determine the Contextual Clue’s Relationship with the Rest of the Sentence Determine the relationship that the contextual clue creates between the blank and the different parts of the sentence. In the example, the phrase “due to” indicates that the word in the blank will characterize someone willing to pursue unethical means to generate profits. Step 3: Predict Your Own Word for the Blank From Step 2, you know that the word in the blank will describe someone who will take extreme measures to make money. What would be an appropriate word to describe this behavior? Greed comes to mind. Step 4: Select the Answer That Best Matches Your Prediction Among the five choices, the closest synonym for greed is avarice. The correct answer is E. </p>

          <p>5. A and E To determine the word for the second blank, you can use the process outlined earlier. The contextual clue “until” indicates that the writer did something to his skills to change them from “weaknesses” to “virtues.” Now make your prediction. If the writer made weaknesses into virtues, then he probably refined his weaknesses. Now find the word in the choices that most closely matches refined. Of the choices, the word that most closely matches refined is honing. Thus the correct answer for the second blank is E. Now to determine the word for the first blank, assume that honing is in the second place, and go through the same process as before. The word in the blank refers to an erroneous belief about the author’s “mastery of the novelistic form.” If the writer “spent years honing his skills,” then the talent took time to develop. It would thus be erroneous to believe that the talents were based on “instinct.” Of the choices, the phrase that most closely matches “instinct” is innate abilities. The correct choice for the first blank is A. </p>

          <p>6. A and E The causal word “since” indicates that the teammates’ feelings about verbalizing their feelings explains why they remained silent. You know that the feelings were “hostile” and the teammates were afraid that these feelings would “undermine” something necessary for the team’s success. So to make the prediction, ask the following question: What component of team success would “hostile” feelings most likely “undermine”? A good prediction is unity. Now look at the choices, and find the two words closest in meaning to unity. The best choices are harmony and cooperation. The correct answer is A and E. </p>

But notice that there is no synonym for apathetic and no synonym for exaggerated. Thus without even seeing the sentence, you can eliminate choices D and E! This strategy could have helped you in the original question in this section. Perhaps you chose diligence as one of your answers. However, if you look back at the choices, you’ll notice that there are no synonyms for diligence. Thus diligence could not have been correct. </p>

      <div id="passage2" class="passage">
        <p>Scientists have long acknowledged that the deterioration of the ocean’s coral reef ecosystems is at least partly due to the effects of global climate change. One of the primary consequences of this change in climate has been the disruption of the symbiotic relationship between the polyps that compose coral reefs and the algae that feed on these polyps. Researchers have identified that the culprit for much of this disruption is coral “bleaching,” which occurs when the algae feeding on the polyps die and therefore lose their green pigmentation. The prevailing explanation for coral bleaching has been that the increase in the ocean’s temperature disrupts the process of photosynthesis—the conversion of light into energy—and thereby kills the algae. However, recent research has shown that such bleaching occurs even in the absence of light.</p>
        <p>Tolleter and his team of scientists showed that bleaching still occurs even if the algae are heat-stressed in the dark. This finding is significant because during the dark, the algae’s photosynthetic machinery is turned off, meaning that the heat’s effect on the algae must occur by disrupting cellular processes other than photosynthesis. Tolleter’s findings, though keeping intact the belief that ocean temperatures affect bleaching, question the exact mechanism through which this bleaching occurs. Future research is necessary to identify the other routes by which bleaching occurs, but these findings, by implicating additional mechanisms in the process of bleaching, should point scientists toward new directions in identifying ways to decelerate this bleaching process.</p>

          <p>8. D
            <li>Choice A. Remember the importance of evidence. The author does not question whether bleaching occurs. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice B. This is a trap answer. In the third sentence, the author states: “Researchers have identified that the culprit for much of this disruption is coral ‘bleaching,’ which occurs when the algae feeding on the polyps die and therefore lose their green pigmentation.” Thus the author does explain the process of bleaching. However, the point of the passage is not to discuss this process. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice C. The author does more than just explain the role of photosynthesis in bleaching; he provides evidence that refutes it. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice D. This answer successfully addresses the scope of the passage. The author spends the second paragraph refuting the view that bleaching occurs because of a disruption of photosynthesis, and concludes by saying that “these findings . . . should point scientists toward new directions in identifying ways to decelerate this bleaching process.” → Correct</li>
            <li>Choice E. This choice is too broad. Though the author does state that bleaching is due to global warming, the passage is not primarily concerned with the effects of global warming. → Incorrect</li>

          <p>9. C
            <li>Choice A. The passage states that Tolleter’s team focused on the cellular mechanisms behind coral bleaching. The role of climate change is not questioned. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice B. At first glance, this answer might appear correct. However, the author explicitly states that Tolleter’s findings “question the exact mechanism through which this bleaching occurs.” Questioning the mechanism is different from “providing a new explanation.” Since there is no evidence that Tolleter’s team has provided a new explanation, eliminate Choice B. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice C. This choice restates the author’s description of the significance of Tolleter’s findings. The author states that Tolleter’s findings “question the exact mechanism through which this bleaching occurs.” Choice C is a restatement of this fact and is thus supported by the passage. → Correct</li>
            <li>Choice D. There is no evidence that Tolleter’s team has “resolved” the debate; instead, they have questioned the “prevailing explanation.” → Incorrect</li>

          <p>10. B and C
            <li>Choice A. The passage questions the role of photosynthesis in coral bleaching by providing evidence that coral bleaching occurs even when the algae are heat-stressed in the dark. Since being heat-stressed in the dark is used as evidence against the role of photosynthesis in coral bleaching, it can be inferred that photosynthesis does not occur in the absence of light. Choice A states the opposite of what can be inferred and is thus incorrect. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice B. The passage states that “the heat’s effect on the algae must occur by disrupting cellular processes other than photosynthesis.” The author discusses the effect of heat on algae in the absence of light to show that bleaching occurs even when the photosynthesis machinery is turned off. → Correct</li>
            <li>Choice C. In the last sentence, the author states that Tolleter’s findings suggest that additional mechanisms must be implicated as causes for coral bleaching. The term “additional” implies “in addition to photosynthesis.” → Correct</li>

          <p>11. 4 In the first paragraph, the author introduces the background of coral bleaching and previous explanations for it, so you should look there.

        <p>Two software producers, DigiCom and EverDrop, recently launched new word processors. The two word processors are comparably priced, and each received highly favorable reviews during independent consumer tests. Nonetheless, since DigiCom has spent more money than EverDrop on advertising, sales of the DigiCom word processor will greatly exceed those of the EverDrop word processor.</p>

        <div class="question"><p>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the author’s prediction?</p></div>
        <div class="choices">
          <p>A DigiCom’s production team spent twice as many hours refining the usability of its current word processor as it did refining the usability of its previous word processor.</p>
          <p>B Any large differences between the two word processors are obvious only to users with specific experience in software engineering.</p>
          <p>C News and media outlets have not extensively publicized the release of DigiCom and EverDrop’s software.</p>
          <p>D DigiCom’s advertising budget for the new word processor is greater than its advertising budget for any of its other lines of software.</p>
          <p>E EverDrop’s advertising team is well-known for perfectly tailoring the company’s ads to its target demographic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="C">
          <p>12. C In the previous passage, the argument is the following: Nonetheless, since DigiCom has spent more money than EverDrop on advertising, the sales of the DigiCom word processor will greatly exceed those of the EverDrop word processor. The claim is that sales of the DigiCom word processor will greatly exceed those of the EverDrop word processor. This claim is based on the premise that “DigiCom has spent more money than EverDrop on advertising.” A major assumption in the previous argument is that increased advertising will actually lead to increased sales.
            <li>Choice A. The argument of the passage concerns the link between increased advertising and increased sales. The usability of the software is irrelevant to the passage’s argument. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice B. The argument of the passage concerns the link between increased advertising and increased sales. The ability of users to differentiate between the word processors is irrelevant. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice C. This choice strengthens the link between the premise and the conclusion. You want an answer choice showing that increased advertisements will lead to increased sales for DigiCom. If the given statement in Choice C is true, then the possibility that the advertising will be ineffective due to prior publicizing of the software is eliminated. By eliminating a potential weakness, Choice C strengthens the argument. → Correct</li>
            <li>Choice D. This choice might be tempting since it addresses DigiCom’s advertising budget. However, it does not address the gap between advertising and increased revenues. You are already told that DigiCom will spend more money than EverDrop on advertising. The fact that this advertising budget is greater than for any other DigiCom line of software is irrelevant. → Incorrect</li>
            <li>Choice E. In contrast to the other three wrong choices, this choice does impact the argument. However, it does so by weakening the argument instead of strengthening it. Recall that you are looking for information that supports the claim that DigiCom’s increased advertising of its product will lead to an increase in sales of that product. If Choice E is true, then the link between increased advertising and increased revenue is broken. Why? Because the choice provides evidence showing that DigiCom’s increase in advertising might not lead to an increase in revenue. Thus Choice E impacts the argument, but does so by weakening the argument rather than strengthening it. → Incorrect</li>
