        <p>When Tocqueville came to America in 1831, he expressed a sentiment that is echoed in the works of Bloom and Kennedy: that American democracy, by encouraging dissent, can lead to its own undoing. But in contrast to the pessimism that dominates Bloom’s and Kennedy’s thinking, Tocqueville’s analysis went a step further. While acknowledging the seeming inevitability of dissent among the citizenry, he also recognized that beneath this frustration there lay a fundamental belief that democratic politics would ultimately amend the situations that aroused complaint. As Tocqueville noted, at any given point in time democracy can appear chaotic, shallow, and contradictory. But, he noted, it was never stagnant. For Tocqueville, democracy’s tendency to encourage and accommodate discontent was its greatest virtue. Because it is self-correcting, a properly run democratic system would ultimately benefit from any discontent because the system is designed to rectify the problem.</p>

        <p>One of the key necessities for understanding an organism’s evolutionary history is the identification of the habitats in which the organism’s ancestors thrived. Biologists have developed such techniques as radiocarbon dating and biochronology to date fossils and thereby arrive at an approximate range for an organism’s existence. But knowing that an organism existed during a certain time period says little about the environment that the organism inhabited. Since the earth periodically goes through heating and cooling periods, biologists cannot simply assume that a region’s current climate is the same as it was for, say, a lemur that inhabited that region six million years ago.</p>
        <p>To get past this quandary, biologists study the fossils of foraminifera, which are microscopic organisms suspended in the waters of the world’s oceans. Foraminifera consume two types of oxygen isotope: oxygen-16 and oxygen-18. Oxygen-16 is lighter than oxygen-18, and as global temperatures rise, more oxygen-16 than oxygen-18 evaporates. By studying the fossils of foraminifera, researchers are able to identify the concentrations of these two isotopes at a given time. Researchers can then use the different ratios of the two isotopes during different time periods to make highly educated inferences about the global climate during a specific time period.</p>

        <p>A detailed look into the past 13,000 years of human history reveals an important trend. The ascent of European civilization and its conquest of other cultures is not a result of some sort of inborn superiority on the part of the European conquerors. Rather, this cultural “success” is attributable to the confluence of favorable environmental conditions and fortuitous cultural events. Or so argues Diamond, in his wellreceived analysis of the Western world’s rise to dominance.</p>
        <p>Diamond provides a wealth of data to support his point. Citing variables as varied as the mineral composition of a local region, fluctuations in weather, and access to docile animals, he argues that the development and evolution of any civilization is contingent on external variables. Since these variables are inherently uncontrollable, the civilizations for which these factors were aligned favorably were the ones that were most likely to thrive. Though Diamond’s use of detailed evidence is refreshing, and his ability to use such disparate information to draw broad conclusions is creative, it is the sweeping nature of his conclusions that makes his argument problematic. The very act of making inferences about local environments thousands of years ago is fraught with the potential for error, but Diamond gives little weight to these concerns. Indeed, by placing excessive emphasis on this data, he paints a simplistic portrait of the past 13,000 years of human history that only passingly acknowledges the roles of the individual human actors and their cultures. Paradoxically, in rightfully trying to debunk myths about Eurasian supremacy, Diamond marginalizes the cultures that he is attempting to defend.</p>

        <p>Lucian Freud famously remarked that anything he might say about his art is as relevant to the art as the noise a tennis player emits when hitting a ball. Freud presented this analogy as a way of capturing his belief about the relationship between artist and art: It is the art that lends significance to the artist, and not the other way around. Such a view, while unorthodox for any epoch, was especially so for the time period in which Freud created his major works. In the 20th-century, the lines between art and consumer culture became blurred, and selfpromotion became de rigueur for most major artists of the period. Freud’s tendency to deflect attention is not, as some commentators have stated, wholly a by-product of a desire to prevent encroachments into his personal life. Rather, it is predominantly a function of his deep-seated belief that if one’s art is given a place of prominence, the careful critic will be able to discern the thought processes and motivations of the artist.</p>

A and C Choice A: The author states “Freud’s tendency to deflect attention is not, as some commentators have stated, wholly a by-product of a desire to prevent encroachments into his personal life.” The use of the word “wholly” implies that his rejection of self-promotion is somewhat motivated by a desire to maintain his privacy. Thus Choice A is correct. Choice B: Though Freud’s beliefs about art were unorthodox for a 20th-century artist, nothing in the passage suggests that a desire to be unorthodox motivated his rejection of self-promotion. Thus Choice B is incorrect. Choice C: The passage implies that Freud rejected self-promotion because he wanted to give his art “a place of prominence.” Thus Choice C is correct. </p>

The claim uses a percentage to draw a conclusion about an actual value.

Sepoma must have sources of revenue other than its own furniture. Choice A is the correct answer because it shows that Sepoma makes money by selling parts to other manufacturers. If the revenue for the furniture of those other manufacturers decreased, then Sepoma’s revenue would have decreased as well.
