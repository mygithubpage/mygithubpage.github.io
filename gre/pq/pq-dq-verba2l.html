        <p> Supernovas in the Milky Way are the likeliest source for most of the cosmic rays reaching Earth. However, calculations show that supernovas cannot produce ultrahigh-energycosmic rays (UHECRs), which have energies exceeding 1018 electron volts. It would seem sensible to seek the source of these in the universe’s most conspicuous energy factories: quasars and gamma-ray bursts billions of light-years away from Earth. But UHECRs tend to collide with photons of the cosmic microwave background–pervasive radiation that is a relic of the early universe. The odds favor a collision every 20 million light-years, each collision costing 20 percent of the cosmic ray’s energy. Consequently, no cosmic ray traveling much beyond 100 million light-years can retain the energy observed in UHECRs.For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <p>It can be inferred that the author of the passage would agree with which of the following about the origin of UHECRs that reach Earth?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="choices">
          <p>A The origin is something other than supernovas in the Milky Way.</p>
          <p>B The origin is most likely something other than very distant quasars or gamma-ray bursts.</p>
          <p>C The origin is most likely no more than a little over 100 million light-years away from Earth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
          <p>All three choicesare correct. The question asks about claims the author would agree with. Choice Ais correct: The passage states that supernovas in the Milky Way “cannot produce ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.” Choice Bis correct: Since very distant quasars and gamma-ray bursts are “billions of light-years away from Earth,” they are too far away for a UHECR to reach Earth. Choice Cis correct: The last sentence of the passage states that “no cosmic ray traveling much beyond 100 million light-years can retain the energy observed in UHECRs.”</p>

          <p>A It explains a criterion that was employed earlier in the argument.</p>

          <p>D It overturns an assumption on which an opposing position depends.</p>
          <p>E It states the main conclusion that the author is seeking to establish.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation" data-answer="B">
          <p>The last sentence is the conclusion of an argument in the last half of the passage; it puts a constraint on the possible origin of UHECRs relative to Earth and thereby rules out the possibility, mentioned earlier in the passage, that distant quasars and gamma-r ay bursts could be the origin of UHECRs. Therefore Choice Cis correct. It is important to note that the last sentence does not show any plausible position to be self-contradictory (Choice B), and that it does not state the author’s main conclusion (Choice E), since it is relevant to only one of the two hypotheses considered in the passage.</p>

        <p> The massive influx of women cyclists–making up at least a third of the total market– was perhaps the most striking and profound social consequence of the mid-1890s cycling boom. Although the new, improved bicycle had appealed immediately to a few privileged women, its impact would have been modest had it not attracted a greater cross section of the female population. It soon became apparent that many of these pioneer women bicyclists had not taken up the sport as an idle pastime. Rather, they saw cycling as a noble cause to be promoted among all women as a means to improve the general female condition. Not only would cycling encourage healthy outdoor exercise, they reasoned, it would also hasten long-overdue dress reform. To feminists, the bicycle affirmed nothing less than the dignity and equality of women. </p>

          <p>Choice Cis correct. The question asks which of three statements about women cyclists are supported by the passage. Choice A is incorrect: The second sentence of the passage states that the new bicycle appealed to a few privileged women right away, but then implies that it quickly “attracted a greater cross section of the female population.” Choice B is incorrect: The third sentence of the passage explicitly states that many women “had not taken up [bicycling] as an idle pastime.” Choice Cis correct: The penultimate sentence of the passage implies that women bicyclists thought that cycling would “encourage healthy outdoor exercise.”</p>

          <p>The second sentence implies that the bicycle appealed at first only to “a few privileged women” but then “attracted a greater cross section of the female population,” thus informing the reader that “the massive influx of women cyclists” mentioned in the previous sentence did not happen all at once. Since the influx of women cyclists is the social consequence of the cycling boom mentioned in the previous sentence, the highlighted sentence describes this consequence in more detail. Therefore, Choice B is correct. The second sentence does not correct any misconceptions (Choice A), provide help in understanding the appeal of the bicycle to privileged women (Choice C), explain the attraction cycling held for a significant cross section of women (Choice D), or describe demographic characteristics of the consumer market for bicycles (Choice E).</p>

        <p> What causes a helix in nature to appear with either a dextral (right-handed, or clockwise) twist or a sinistral (left-handed, or counterclockwise) twist is one of the most intriguing puzzles in the science of form. Most spiral-shaped snail species are predominantly dextral. But at one time, handedness (twist direction of the shell) was equally distributed within some snail species that have become predominantly dextral or, in a few species, predominantly sinistral. What mechanisms control handedness and keep left-handedness rare?</p>
        <p>It would seem unlikely that evolution should discriminate against sinistral snails if sinistral and dextral snails are exact mirror images, for any disadvantage that a sinistral twist in itself could confer on its possessor is almost inconceivable. But left- and right-handed snails are not actually true mirror images of one another. Their shapes are noticeably different. Sinistral rarity might, then, be a consequence of possible disadvantages conferred by these other concomitant structural features. In addition, perhaps left- and right-handed snails cannot mate with each other, having incompatible twist directions. Presumably an individual of the rarer form would have relative difficulty in finding a mate of the same hand, thus keeping the rare form rare or creating geographically separated right- and left-handed populations.</p>
        <p>But this evolutionary mechanism combining dissymmetry, anatomy, and chance does not provide an adequate explanation of why right-handedness should have become predominant. It does not explain, for example, why the infrequent unions between snails of opposing hands produce fewer offspring of the rarer than the commoner form in species where each parent contributes equally to handedness. Nor does it explain why, in a species where one parent determines handedness, a brood is not exclusively right- or left-handed when the offspring would have the same genetic predisposition. In the European pond snail Lymnaea peregra, a predominantly dextral species whose handedness is maternally determined, a brood might be expected to be exclusively right- or left-handed–and this often occurs. However, some broods possess a few snails of the opposing hand, and in predominantly sinistral broods, the incidence of dextrality is surprisingly high.</p>
        <p>Here, the evolutionary theory must defer to a theory based on an explicit developmental mechanism that can favor either right- or left-handedness. In the case of Lymnaea peregra, studies indicate that a dextral gene is expressed during egg formation; i.e., before egg fertilization, the gene produces a protein, found in the cytoplasm of the egg, that controls the pattern of cell division and thus handedness. In experiments, an injection of cytoplasm from dextral eggs changes the pattern of sinistral eggs, but an injection from sinistral eggs does not influence dextral eggs. One explanation for the differing effects is that all Lymnaea peregraeggs begin left-handed but most switch to being right-handed. Thus the path to a solution to the puzzle of handedness in all snails appears to be as twisted as the helix itself.</p>

          <p>Which of the following would serve as an example of “concomitant structural features” (3) that might disadvantage a snail of the rarer form?</p>

          <p>A A shell and body that are an exact mirror image of a snail of the commoner form</p>

          <p>Choice A is incorrect: the passage states that “any disadvantage that a sinistral twist in itself could confer on its possessor is almost inconceivable.” Choice B is incorrect, as a smaller population would be the consequence of the disadvantage, not the cause of it. Choice C is incorrect, as damage caused by an external object is not a “structural feature” of a snail shell. Choice D is incorrect, as better camouflage is an advantage, not a disadvantage. The correct answer is Choice E: an impaired ability to move around and ingest food would be a disadvantage.</p>

          <p>The first paragraph ends with the question “What mechanisms control handedness and keep left-handedness rare?” The second paragraph attempts to answer this question: perhaps, the paragraph suggests, sinistral rarity is a consequence either of natural selection working on “concomitant structural features,” or of difficulties in mating for left-handed snails. Thus Choice Bis correct. The paragraph starts by dismissing the idea that evolution could be working against left-handedness itself, but Choice A is incorrect because the paragraph is not concerned with offering reasons for that dismissal. The paragraph does not even suggest that opposite-handed populations tend to intermingle (Choice C) or that dextral snails breed more rapidly (Choice E), and it does not discuss developmental mechanisms (Choice D).</p>

Book reviews that point out the author’s transgressions are negative in nature, so the answer to Blank (i) must be negative in meaning; the only answer choice that meets this condition is “adverse,” so it is correct. Thus the correct answer is adverse(Choice B) and transgressions(Choice E).</p>

          <p>The sentence focuses on the relationship between the gaps in existing accounts of a life and the evidence used to produce those accounts. Since “gaps” implies a concern with completeness, the characterization of that evidence that makes the most sense for Blank (ii) is “incomplete.” The other choices, “credible” or “extant,” could explain the accuracy or verifiability of the accounts in question but nothing about the gaps themselves. Once it is determined that “incomplete” is the best choice for characterizing the evidence, it follows that the gaps in the accounts based on that evidence would likely be considerable, so the opposite of considerable, “trifling,” is the correct answer for Blank (i). Thus the correct answer is trifling(Choice A) and incomplete(Choice F).</p>

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="CDH">
          <p>The sentence discusses a purported change in how popular culture and high art are relatively valued; the author is scrutinizing the notion that the academic study of the former has significantly raised its once lowly status. In the last sentence, Blank (iii) is preceded by the word “continued,” indicating that something about intellectuals’ view of the hierarchy of culture has remained unchanged. Since the author states in the first sentence that this hierarchy was once dominant, “investment in” the hierarchy would indicate that sense of continuity. Neither of the other two options is supported by the passage because there is no indication the author believes that intellectuals have a long-held aversion to or misunderstanding of that hierarchy. The “although” that begins the last sentence indicates that the phrase completed by Blank (ii) will contrast the respectability of analyses of popular culture with something that nonetheless reveals a continued allegiance to the hierarchy. A need to explain away a “distaste for” or an “indifference to” action movies or pulp fiction would not indicate any such allegiance, so those choices must be incorrect. However, a need to justify one’s penchant or liking for popular culture would indicate an adherence to the high-low culture hierarchy. Thus “penchant for” is the correct choice for Blank (ii). Finally, since the author is suggesting that the hierarchy given to high and low culture is not obsolete as some claim, it follows that the shift in attitudes is exaggerated; thus, the correct answer to Blank (i) is “overstated.” “Underappreciated” implies the opposite, and “counterproductive” implies a judgment about the value of the hierarchy, whereas the passage is primarily concerned with its existence. Thus the correct answer is overstated(Choice C), penchant for(Choice D), and investment in(Choice H).</p>

          <p>The sentence suggests that more information about a damaging condition will allow researchers to lessen future negative effects. While “specify” and “identify” create sentences with approximately the same meaning, the sentence also suggests that the researchers are seeking to control effects that are already known rather than needing further specificity or identification. Even in this limited context, it is unreasonable that researchers would wish to “exacerbate” or increase the negative effects of damage, and there is no other word that creates a sentence with the same meaning. “Stabilize” implies that the negative effects would simply be controlled, rather than lessened, and likewise there is no other word that produces a sentence with the same meaning.

While “ubiquitous” and “everywhere” produce sentences with the same meaning, they assume an increase in volume or sales that is not necessarily implied by innovatory breakthroughs.

          <p>The sentence describes the variable courses of three different societies after the beginning of a transition, and the blank characterizes the differences among these courses. While “rural” and “quotidian” may describe a common quality of each course, they do not emphasize their variability. And while the words “novel” and “unfamiliar” are alike in meaning, they do not fit the context, since one of the paths taken (sticking to foraging) is precisely neither novel nor unfamiliar. Thus the correct answer is divergent (Choice A) and disparate(Choice E). 4.

          <p>The sentence suggests that vitamin E supplements are ineffective in deterring the disease, and the use of the word “despite” indicates that this ineffectiveness contrasts with how they are widely viewed. The words that fill the blank, then, must mean the opposite of “ineffectiveness.” Among the answer choices, the words that do so are “efficacy” and “usefulness.” Of the other choices, “potential” is tempting, but it does not contrast as directly with “ineffectiveness,” nor does it have a near synonym among the other answers with which it could be paired. “Prevalence” and “popularity” might be initially attractive because the passage suggests that these words might describe the use of vitamin E supplements, but the blank calls for a word that characterizes how they are viewed rather than how they are used.
