The assumption underlying this argument is that the only significant difference between the two parts of the store is the presence of sunlight–otherwise, the inherent popularity of goods sold in different locations, or some other factor, might account for the increased sales. Choice Bhelps rule out the possibility that other factors might be involved, by showing that sales are no greater when the sunlight is taken out of the equation. Therefore it is the correct answer. Choices D and E both suggest that factors besides sunlight might explain the discrepancy between sales; therefore they weaken rather than strengthen the argument, and so are incorrect. Neither Choice A nor Choice C point to differences between the two areas of the store; therefore they are both incorrect as well.</p></div></div><div id="passage2" class="passage"><p> While the best sixteenth-century Renaissance scholars mastered the classics of ancient Roman literature in the original Latin and understood them in their original historical context, most of the scholars’ educated contemporaries knew the classics only from school lessons on selected Latin texts. These were chosen by Renaissance teachers after much deliberation, for works written by and for the sophisticated adults of pagan Rome were not always considered suitable for the Renaissance young: the central Roman classics refused (as classics often do) to teach appropriate morality and frequently suggested the opposite. Teachers accordingly made students’ needs, not textual and historical accuracy, their supreme interest, chopping dangerous texts into short phrases, and using these to impart lessons extemporaneously on a variety of subjects, from syntax to science. Thus, I believe that a modern reader cannot know the associations that a line of ancient Roman poetry or prose had for any particular educated sixteenth-century reader.</p></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question"><p>The passage is primarily concerned with discussing the</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A unsuitability of the Roman classics for the teaching of morality</p><p>B approach that sixteenth-century scholars took to learning the Roman classics</p><p>C effect that the Roman classics had on educated people in the Renaissance</p><p>D way in which the Roman classics were taught in the sixteenth century</p><p>E contrast between the teaching of the Roman classics in the Renaissance and the teaching of the Roman classics today</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The passage focuses primarily on the way Roman classics were taught during the Renaissance, so Choice Dis the correct answer. The approach that sixteenth-century scholars took is mentioned, but it serves only to introduce and contrast with the pedagogical methods used in schools; therefore Choice B is incorrect. The passage mentions a supposed incompatibility between Roman classics and the teaching of morality as motivating Renaissance teaching methods, but that incompatibility is not the passage’s main topic; thus Choice A is incorrect. Choices C and E are also incorrect, since the passage does not discuss the effect of Roman classics on educated Renaissance people or the teaching of Roman classics today.</p></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question"><p>The information in the passage suggests that which of the following would most likely result from a student’s having studied the Roman classics under a typical sixteenth-century teacher?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A The student recalls a line of Roman poetry in conjunction with a point learned about grammar.</p><p>B The student argues that a Roman poem about gluttony is not morally offensive when it is understood in its historical context.</p><p>C The student is easily able to express thoughts in Latin.</p><p>D The student has mastered large portions of the Roman classics.</p><p>E The student has a sophisticated knowledge of Roman poetry but little knowledge of Roman prose.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>Choice Ais correct. The passage specifically mentions syntax as one of the subjects that the pieces of text served to illustrate; therefore it is logical that students would associate the text with the grammar point it was used to teach. Choices B and D are incorrect because the passage implies that students were not given the context or tools to place Roman classics in context, or to read and master large portions of works. Choices C and E are also incorrect, since the passage makes no mention of Latin composition being taught, or of any differences in the ways in which Roman poetry and prose were treated in schools.</p></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the assertion made in the passage concerning what a modern reader cannot know?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A Some modern readers are thoroughly familiar with the classics of ancient Roman literature because they majored in classics in college or obtained doctoral degrees in classics.</p><p>B Some modern readers have learned which particular works of Roman literature were taught to students in the sixteenth century.</p><p>C Modern readers can, with some effort, discover that sixteenth-century teachers selected some seemingly dangerous classical texts while excluding other seemingly innocuous texts.</p><p>D Copies of many of the classical texts used by sixteenth-century teachers, including marginal notes describing the oral lessons that were based on the texts, can be found in museums today.</p><p>E Many of the writings of the best sixteenth-century Renaissance scholars have been translated from Latin and are available to modern readers.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="D"><p>The passage asserts that modern readers cannot know the associations Roman poetry had for Renaissance readers, because those associations arose from the specific ways Roman texts were presented in schools. This assertion assumes that there is no way for modern readers to know how such texts were taught during the Renaissance. Choice D shows a way that scholars can recover this pedagogical context and is therefore the correct choice. Since the passage’s assertion does not depend on modern readers’ familiarity with the classics, with their knowledge of which works were taught in schools, with the inclusion or exclusion by sixteenth-century teachers of specific texts, or with the accessibility of the works of Renaissance scholars, all the other choices are incorrect. </p></div></div><div id="passage3" class="passage"><p> In humans, the pilomotor reflex leads to the response commonly known as goose bumps, and this response is widely considered to be vestigial–that is, something formerly having a greater physiological advantage than at present. It occurs when the tiny muscle at the base of a hair follicle contracts, pulling the hair upright. In animals with feathers, fur, or quills, this creates a layer of insulating warm air or a reason for predators to think twice before attacking. But human hair is too puny to serve these functions. Goose bumps in humans may, however, have acquired a new role. Like flushing–another thermoregulatory (heat-regulating) mechanism–goose bumps have become linked with emotional responses, notably fear, rage, or the pleasure of, say, listening to beautiful music. They may thus serve as a signal to others.</p></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage3"><div class="question"><p>In explaining the “new role” () that goose bumps in humans may have acquired, the author assumes which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A Emotional responses in humans can be triggered by thermoregulatory mechanisms.</p><p>B The perceptibility of emotional responses to other humans offers some kind of benefit.</p><p>C If human hair were more substantial, goose bumps would not have acquired a new role.</p><p>D Goose bumps in animals with feathers, fur, or quills may also be linked to emotional responses.</p><p>E In humans, goose bumps represent an older physiological response than flushing.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>The passage addresses the question of why the pilomotor reflex has survived in human beings despite the fact that its original functions–to insulate and to appear larger to predators–are no longer useful. The suggested reason is that the reflex “has acquired a new role,” namely, as a means to signal to others that one is experiencing a strong emotion. This assumes that the ability to send such a signal is useful to human beings; therefore Choice Bis correct.</p></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage3"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following best describes the primary function of the next-to-last sentence (“Like … music”)?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A It makes a distinction between two types of mechanisms.</p><p>B It corrects a common misconception about the role of goose bumps in humans.</p><p>C It suggests reasons for the connection between emotional responses and goose bumps in humans.</p><p>D It suggests that flushing and goose bumps signal the same emotional state.</p><p>E It helps explain a possible role played by goose bumps in humans.</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="E"><p>The next-to-last sentence says that goose bumps in humans now serve as an outward sign of strong emotion.

In his study of Douglass’ career as a major figure in the movement to abolish slavery and as a spokesman for Black rights, Waldo Martin has provoked controversy by contending that Douglass also deserves a prominent place in the intellectual history of the United States because he exemplified so many strands of nineteenth-century thought: romanticism, idealism, individualism, liberal humanism, and an unshakable belief in progress. But this very argument provides ammunition for those who claim that most of Douglass’ ideas, being so representative of their time, are now obsolete. Douglass’ vision of the future as a melting pot in which all racial and ethnic differences would dissolve into “a composite American nationality” appears from the pluralist perspective of many present-day intellectuals to be not only utopian but even wrongheaded. Yet there is a central aspect of Douglass’ thought that seems not in the least bit dated or irrelevant to current concerns. He has no rival in the history of the nineteenth-century United States as an insistent and effective critic of the doctrine of innate racial inequality. He not only attacked racist ideas in his speeches and writings, but he offered his entire career and all his achievements as living proof that racists were wrong in their belief that one race could be inherently superior to another.</p><p>While Martin stresses Douglass’ antiracist egalitarianism, he does not adequately explain how this aspect of Douglass’ thought fits in with his espousal of the liberal Victorian attitudes that many present-day intellectuals consider to be naÃ¯ve and outdated. The fact is that Douglass was attracted to these democratic-capitalist ideals of his time because they could be used to attack slavery and the doctrine of White supremacy. His favorite rhetorical strategy was to expose the hypocrisy of those who, while professing adherence to the ideals of democracy and equality of opportunity, condoned slavery and racial discrimination. It would have been strange indeed if he had not embraced liberal idealism, because it proved its worth for the cause of racial equality during the national crisis that eventually resulted in emancipation and citizenship for African Americans. These points may seem obvious, but had Martin given them more attention, his analysis might have constituted a more convincing rebuttal to those critics who dismiss Douglass’ ideology as a relic of the past. If one accepts the proposition that Douglass’ deepest commitment was to Black equality and that he used the liberal ideals of his time as weapons in the fight for that cause, then it is hard to fault him for seizing the best weapons at hand.</p></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage4"><div class="question"><p>The passage as a whole can best be described as doing which of the following?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A Explaining Douglass’ emergence as a major figure in the movement to abolish slavery</p><p>B Tracing the origins of Douglass’ thought in nineteenth-century romanticism, idealism, and liberal humanism</p><p>C Analyzing Douglass’ speeches and writings from a modern, pluralist perspective</p><p>D Criticizing Martin for failing to stress the contradiction between Douglass’ principles and the liberal Victorian attitudes of his day</p><p>E Formulating a response to those who consider Douglass’ political philosophy to be archaic and irrelevant</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="E"><p>The passage discusses the views and intellectual legacy of Frederick Douglass.

The second paragraph critiques a study of Douglass’ career by Waldo Martin and claims that Martin has failed to offer a “convincing rebuttal to those critics who dismiss Douglass’ ideology as a relic of the past” (lines 30—31).

This rules out Choices A, B, C, and E and leaves Choice Das correct. Indeed, the mention of “Douglass’ vision of the future as a melting pot in which all racial and ethnic differences would dissolve” (lines 10—11) shows that Douglass was not a pluralist, i.e. was not someone who aimed at preserving and celebrating ethnic and cultural differences.</p></div></div><div id="passage5" class="passage"><p> The plant called the scarlet gilia can have either red or white flowers. It had long been thought that hummingbirds, which forage by day, pollinate its red flowers and that hawkmoths, which forage at night, pollinate its white flowers.

But to prove that they are attracted preferentially to those colors requires knowing whether they also pollinate flowers of the other color that are uncovered during their respective foraging hours–white flowers uncovered during hummingbirds’ daytime hours, and red flowers uncovered during hawkmoths’ nocturnal hours. Choice D states that such plants remain unpollinated, so it is the correct answer. Of the other options, both Choices C and E could suggest the opposite of what is required, so they are incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the comparative frequency at which uncovered gilia flowers are pollinated has no bearing on the argument. Likewise, the presence of some quantity of unpollinated flowers of either color does not affect the argument, so Choice B is also incorrect.</p></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>The media once portrayed the governor as anything but ineffective; they now, however, make her out to be the epitome of _________.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A fecklessness</p><p>B brilliance</p><p>C dynamism</p><p>D egoism</p><p>E punctiliousness</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="A"><p>The sentence contrasts the media’s former and current depictions of the governor. Since the governor was once presented as “anything but ineffective,” the media once saw her as extremely competent. It follows that the phrase completed by the blank will have the opposite meaning. To be the epitome of something is to be representative of that trait, so the blank must be filled with a word that implies incompetence. “Brilliance,” “dynamism,” and “punctiliousness” are all positive traits, so they do not work in this context. “Egoism,” while often thought of as a negative trait, does not imply incompetence. That leaves “fecklessness,” whose meaning includes ineffectiveness, making it a very good contrast with the first half of the sentence. Thus, the correct answer is fecklessness(Choice A).</p></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>For most of the first half of the nineteenth century, science at the university was in _________ state, despite the presence of numerous luminaries.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A a scintillating</p><p>B a pathetic</p><p>C a controversial</p><p>D an incendiary</p><p>E a veracious </p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="B"><p>Since the presence of numerous luminaries, a positive thing, is portrayed as a factor that runs counter to the general state of science at the university, that general state must be negative. Therefore the word that fills the blank must describe a generally negative atmosphere. “Pathetic” certainly does. Of the other answers, “scintillating,” meaning brilliant, is just the opposite of what is called for, while “veracious” is similarly too positive. “Controversial” and “incendiary” both describe an argumentative or explosive environment that would not necessarily be mitigated by the presence of numerous luminaries.

Therefore, the phrase “(i) linked to” and the answer to Blank (ii) must be identical or very similar in meaning. The only answer choices that are related in this way are “intimately” and “inseparable from”: if two things are “intimately linked,” then they are very plausibly “inseparable from” each other.

Furthermore, the quality of the sound must be in contrast with the apparent energy of the performers. The only answer choice for Blank (ii) that meets these conditions is “tepid,” so it is correct. The sentence as a whole suggests that the setting of the concert had a negative effect on the performance; the answer choice for Blank (i) that best fits this meaning is “exacted a toll,” so it is correct. Answer Choice B for Blank (i), “encouraged nervousness,” is also negative in meaning, but it is incorrect, because the sentence does not talk about the psychological state of the musicians or the audience.

The only answer choice for Blank (ii) that has this meaning is “end,” so it is correct. The answer to Blank (i) must be a word that denotes the initial phase of a gradual process that ends with the complete elimination of the media’s influence; the answer choice that fits this meaning is “erode,” so it is correct.

Given this omission, it follows that data about female labor would be hard to come by, making it difficult to measure its growth; therefore “track” is the correct answer for Blank (i). As for the other choices, since the author asserts that the role of female labor has routinely been overlooked, “ignore” cannot be correct. The conjunction “yet” in the first sentence indicates that the phrase containing Blank (i) contrasts with the importance of female labor; since “overestimate” emphasizes this importance, it also cannot be correct. The second sentence places research about female labor during industrialization into the larger context of research about women; the word “despite” that begins the sentence indicates that the latter runs counter to trends in the larger field. Neither “gaps” nor “disinterest” would provide the necessary contrast between the two, since “gaps” in the larger field of research about women would mirror the omission of the role of female labor and “disinterest” would explain such omissions.</p></div></div><div id="question18" data-choice-type="radio"><div class="question"><p>It is a sad but just indictment of some high school history textbooks that they frequently report as (i) claims that historians hotly debate or that are even completely (ii) by (iii) primary sources. </p></div><div class="choices"><p>A factual</p><p>B controversial</p><p>C sensational</p></div><div class="choices"><p>D resolved</p><p>E corroborated</p><p>F contradicted</p></div><div class="choices"><p>G dubious</p><p>H incomplete</p><p>I reliable</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AFI"><p>The use of the word “indictment,” meaning a charge of wrongdoing, indicates that the sentence is sharply criticizing the textbooks in question and that the blanks must be completed with words that support this critique. Blank (i) describes how such textbooks characterize historical claims that are hotly debated. Since such claims are in fact controversial, it would not be surprising or inaccurate for textbooks to report them as such, so “controversial” is not correct. Of the other two responses, “sensational” has some merit, suggesting that the textbooks resort to a melodramatic presentation of historical debate; however, “factual” is the better choice, implying as it does gross inaccuracies. That the critique of the textbooks centers upon accuracy rather than tone is confirmed by the rest of the sentence, which deals with the relationship between the textbooks’ claims and the primary sources upon which historical scholarship is based. The “even” that precedes Blank (ii) calls for a word that is yet further away from factual than “hotly debated.” Of the choices, only “contradicted” fits this criterion; the other two options are the opposite of what is needed. Finally, Blank (iii) calls for a word that describes the primary sources. Since the critique of the textbooks’ accuracy rests upon their divergence from these sources, the sources themselves must be characterized as authoritative. “Reliable” does exactly that, while “dubious” and “incomplete” suggest the opposite.

Since less heat lost means more warmth, a word that means preventing or slowing heat loss is required for Blank (i). “Inhibiting” is therefore the answer. “Exacerbating” has the opposite meaning, while “replicating” makes no sense in this context. Since the first sentence asserts that daytime highs are increasing less rapidly than nighttime lows, Blank (ii) calls for a verb that indicates a moderation in rises in temperature during the day, and “restrain” has this sense. “Augment,” meaning to increase, has the opposite meaning, while “mask” would indicate that measurements are not reflecting actual increases in temperature, an idea not supported by the rest of the passage. The “because” in the last sentence indicates that the second clause explains how daytime temperature increases are restrained; it does so by making reference to solar energy and the evaporation of moisture. Because solar energy is responsible for increases in daytime temperature, the answer to Blank (iii) requires a word that explains how evaporation can lessen or divert that energy for other purposes. “Used up in” does this because it indicates that less solar energy is available to warm the Earth’s surface when a portion of it is instead devoted to evaporation. Neither “intensified by” nor “unrelated to” indicate a connection between solar energy and evaporation that would lessen warming.

Both “foresighted” and “prescient” suggest that the band’s musical strategy anticipated the trends of the coming decades, so they are the correct choice. Of the other responses, “fortuitous” and “serendipitous” are similar in meaning, but they do not fit well with the word “surprisingly,” nor with the emphasis on the band’s having a long-term strategy. Neither “popular” nor “lucrative” have a synonym among the other choices; moreover, they too go beyond the sentence’s emphasis on the band’s seemingly timeless style. Thus the correct answer is foresighted (Choice B) and prescient(Choice C).</p></div></div><div id="question21" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Factory production made an absence of imperfections so blandly commonplace that the _________ of hand-produced goods were now cherished where they once might have been shunned.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A advantages</p><p>B revivals</p><p>C benefits</p><p>D pretensions</p><p>E blemishes</p><p>F defects</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="EF"><p>The sentence suggests a contrast between the quality of factory-produced goods, marked by an absence of imperfections, with that of hand-produced goods, which must possess such imperfections. The words “blemishes” and “defects” are the only ones that connote imperfection.While “advantages” and “benefits” produce sentences with the same meaning, they neither connote imperfection nor make sense as one would not necessarily shun a product with such positive attributes. The word “revivals” also does not connote imperfection, and there is no other word that would produce a sentence with the same meaning. Thus the correct answer is blemishes (Choice E) and defects(Choice F).</p></div></div><div id="question22" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Through its state associations, the American Medical Association controlled who could become a physician and dominated _________ professions like nursing and occupational therapy.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A commensurate</p><p>B proportionate</p><p>C kindred</p><p>D affiliated</p><p>E imperative</p><p>F voluntary</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CD"><p>The blank calls for words that will describe professions such as nursing and occupational therapy as they relate to physicians. These professions are also in the health-care field; the answer choices “kindred” and “affiliated” both suggest this close relationship and produce completed sentences that are similar in meaning. Of the other choices, both “commensurate” and “proportionate” suggest some sort of comparative measurement between the professions mentioned, something unsupported by the rest of the sentence. Neither “imperative” nor “voluntary” would typically be used to describe “profession” nor does either have a word close in meaning among the other choices with which it could be paired. Thus the correct answer is kindred(Choice C) and affiliated(Choice D).</p></div></div><div id="question23" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>In a strong indication of the way the entire party is _________ the candidate with moderate credentials, the outspokenly conservative former mayor of a major city has promised to raise a substantial amount of money for the candidate’s campaign.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A rallying behind</p><p>B incensed over</p><p>C undecided about</p><p>D mortified over</p><p>E embarrassed about</p><p>F coalescing around</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AF"><p>The former mayor’s promise to raise funds is used as an example of the party’s attitude or actions toward the candidate. Since raising funds is a way of supporting a candidate, the words filling the blank must be positive rather than negative. Only two of the choices given, “rallying behind” and “coalescing around,” indicate a positive attitude toward the candidate; moreover, they also produce similar meanings, so they are the correct answer. The other four choices indicate negative or indifferent attitudes toward the candidate that would not be exemplified by promises of fund-raising. Thus the correct answer is rallying behind(Choice A) and coalescing around (Choice F).</p></div></div><div id="question24" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>Mr. Hirsch says he will aim to preserve the foundation’s support of _________ thinkers, individuals who are going against the trends in a field or an acknowledged set of opinions.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A iconoclastic</p><p>B integrative</p><p>C doctrinaire</p><p>D heterodox</p><p>E dogmatic</p><p>F synthesizing</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AD"><p>The portion of the sentence following the comma defines the type of thinkers characterized by the words that will fill the blank. The challenge posed by this item, then, is mainly one of vocabulary: the answers must be words that describe individuals who go against the trends in a field or against a set of opinions. “Iconoclastic” and “heterodox” mean exactly that, with both words describing people whose opinions run counter to established norms. Of the other choices, “doctrinaire” and “dogmatic” both mean the opposite–adhering to established principles–while “integrative” and “synthesizing” both refer to a willingness to bring together disparate points of view. Thus the correct answer is iconoclastic(Choice A) and heterodox(Choice D).</p></div></div><div id="question25" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>In France cultural subsidies are _________: producers of just about any film can get an advance from the government against box-office receipts, even though most such loans are never fully repaid.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A ubiquitous</p><p>B invaluable</p><p>C sporadic</p><p>D scanty</p><p>E questionable</p><p>F omnipresent</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="AF"><p>The colon signals that the second part of the sentence provides an example of the first part, so the blank must characterize the idea that just about anyfilm (as an instance of subsidized culture) gets an advance. This rules out “sporadic” and “scanty” neither of which suggest the pervasiveness of the subsidies. While “invaluable” and “questionable” may make some sense, they do not produce sentences with the same meaning. Thus the correct answer is ubiquitous(Choice A) and omnipresent(Choice F).</p></div></div><div id="question26" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>The problem of avoiding duplicate names–such as for Internet domain names or for e-mail accounts–is particularly _________ when the name has to fit into a format that allows only a finite number of possibilities.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A meager</p><p>B acute</p><p>C agreeable</p><p>D severe</p><p>E beneficial</p><p>F productive</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="BD"><p>The blank must be filled with a word that describes the challenge of ensuring unique names under certain limitations. Since these limitations add to the difficulty of avoiding duplication, the blank must be filled with choices that reflect the arduousness of this task. To characterize the problem as particularly “acute” or “severe” would do this nicely; both adjectives indicate the added difficulty of the problem under the circumstances described, and the pairing renders sentences with similar meanings. None of the other responses describe the difficulty of the problem that the rest of the sentence emphasizes. Thus the correct answer is acute (Choice B) and severe (Choice D).</p></div></div><div id="question27" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>At nearly 450 pages, the novel is _________: the author does not often resist the temptation to finish off a chapter, section, or even paragraph with some unnecessary flourish.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>A instructive</p><p>B complex</p><p>C prolix</p><p>D educational</p><p>E long-winded</p><p>F explicit</p></div><div class="explanation" data-answer="CE"><p>The words that fill the blank in must convey that the novel is not merely long but also contains numerous portions deemed unnecessary. While it may be “instructive” and “educational” these do not properly describe the novel’s length. While “complex” and “explicit” may correlate with (though not characterize) length, they do not produce sentences with the same meaning. Thus the correct answer is prolix (Choice C) and long-winded(Choice E).</p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
