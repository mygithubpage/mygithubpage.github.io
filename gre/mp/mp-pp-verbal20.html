            <p>115. <b>Engaging, a tired.</b> Since the critics viewed the book negatively, as evidenced by “dry pedantry” (a rigid overemphasis on rules or details) and “humorless presentation,” the author must have turned an interesting topic into a tedious one. Thus, the first blank will be positive in tone and the second negative. “Engaging” matches the tone and content. “Affectless,” meaning showing a lack of emotion or sympathy, and “dogmatic,” meaning opinionated or doctrinal, do not match the positive tone needed for the first blank. Similarly, for the second blank, only “a tired” matches the required negative tone; “a worthy” is positive and “an instructive” is neutral.</p>

            <p>116. <b>Rife with contention, critical, seasoned practitioners.</b> This problem is best solved starting from the last blank. Certain “tenets” (principles important to a group of people) are not necessarily accepted as fact (“gospel”) even by those who really believe in the practice of psychoanalysis. These people are “seasoned practitioners,” experienced in psychoanalysis. “Quarrelsome factions” are the opposite of the intended meaning and while “beneficiaries” could work, the sentence does not provide any clues to justify use of the word “esteemed.” Next, move to the second blank. The experts may question “even tenets” that are deemed central to the overall philosophy. The best match is “critical” (crucial). “Immaterial” (unimportant) and “anathema,” used to describe something that is cursed or loathed, do not fit the idea of something that is crucial to the philosophy. Finally, the second sentence provides the necessary clues for the first blank: psychoanalysis is a subject of debate even among those who practice it; it is “rife with contention.” The practitioners do not “ridicule” it or find it “devoid of substance” (lacking substance). Rather, they disagree with some of the principles even as they continue to follow the overall philosophy.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="BEH">
            <p>117. <b>Antipathy, patent, mutual benefit.</b> The first and third blanks are highly related, so consider them first. “Apparent antagonism” exists between two people; are they really so hostile to one another? The two individuals also “derive inspiration and motivation from the other.” In other words, there is a “mutual benefit” to the seemingly hostile relationship, which otherwise might be “written off” as pure hatred, or “antipathy.” Neither “flagrancy” (the act of being flagrant, offensive) nor “hypocrisy” fits the meaning of hatred. For the third blank, both “worthless pride” and “tacit disagreement” are negative in nature; they do not convey a “benefit.” Now return to the second blank. The “apparent antagonism” can be “written off,” so “further scrutiny should render” clear or apparent the fact that there is actually a positive to this “rivalry.” The best fit is “patent” (obvious, evident). “Useless” and “spurious” (not genuine, insincere) do not fit the desired meaning.</p>

            <p>118. <b>Hyperboles.</b> The answer must match the clues “flights of fancy” and “arching far beyond reality.” “Hyperbole” is exaggeration and is the correct answer. “Tit for tat” (retaliation in kind), “parables” (stories with morals), “conundrums” (difficult questions), and “innuendos” (hint or insinuation, often negative) do not fit this meaning.</p>

            <p>119. <b>Initially, given teeth.</b> First, or “initially,” the law in question “had little impact,” but “subsequent legislation” changed this. “Justifiably” and “unbelievably” are value judgments that are not supported by the rest of the sentence. In the second blank, you need something that will contrast with having little impact and will match the idea of a law now gaining “funding and enforcement.” Only “given teeth” has this (metaphorical) meaning. “Rendered moot” and “kept at bay” go against the desired meaning.</p>

            <p>120. <b>Counterpoint.</b> The blank requires a word that means having two distinct components, since the opera is capable of evoking two distinct emotions. “Counterpoint” (use of contrast in a work of art) is a good fit. “Macabre” is a trap, since it goes along with horror but leaves out joy. “Articulate” is related to speech and does not fit here. “Contrived” (not natural, planned) and “figurative” (using metaphor or other non-literal device to convey meaning) are not supported by any clues in the sentence</p>

            <p>115. <b>Utilized, employed.</b> The sentence suggests that despite certain minor “contraindications,” which are specific situations in which a procedure should not be performed, life-saving procedures should be performed when the situation demands. Though first-aid might include medication, procedures would not be “medicated.” And “disputed” does not have a pair in the answer choices, nor would it make sense to dispute any life-saving procedures. While it might be possible for life-saving procedures to be “contrived” or “created,” there is no clue in the sentence to suggest that trainers think that these procedures should be made up. Thus, the correct answers are “utilized” and “employed.”</p>

            <p>116. <b>Mordant, trenchant.</b> The best clue in this sentence is its parallel structure. The judge’s keen eye “was surpassed only by the ______ wit with which she castigated them.” Keen means sharply discerning, so look for words that denote a sharpness, or bitingness, of wit. “Mordant” and “trenchant,” both of which are close in meaning to sharp and discerning, are best. Don’t be confused by the other set of synonyms, “assiduous” and “sedulous,” both of which have meanings close to diligent. “Jurisprudent,” which means skilled in the principles of law, is a trap for those thinking about words that might describe a judge. And someone who is “obtuse” would be slow-witted, a word that is the opposite of what the sentence intends.</p>

A person might “receive” a group of individuals if he or she were welcoming them, but this doesn’t match the intended meaning of the sentence, nor does it match with any other of the answer choices. “Conceded” isn’t the right word either, nor would you concede a group of people (unless you were giving them away to someone else).

This suggests that mathematics enjoys something like rule over these fields; the phrase “Queen of the Sciences” suggests the same. “Hegemony” usually describes the dominance of one state over others, but can also mean the dominance of one social group, political party, etc. “Dominance” will also work. If you anticipated the word autocratic, “autonomy” might be attractive, especially as a pair with “independence,” but autocratic describes government by a single person with unlimited powers, while autonomy means self-governance.

          <p>Naturalism, arising in the 19th century as a literary response to Darwin’s account ofevolution, focused on describing everyday reality but differed from realism in its attemptsto provide a “scientific” foundation for its depictions of characters, stressing the influence ofenvironment and heredity upon the individual psyche. Émile Zola, in particular, saw his craft as an extension of the scientific method into the domain of art. The 19th century, perhapsin opposition to naturalism, saw the rise of the Decadent movement, embracing artificeover nature in writing, championed by Zola’s erstwhile protégé, Joris-Karl Huysmans. Theprotagonist of his masterpiece, <i>Á rebours</i> (literally, <i>Against the Grain</i>, but more commonlytranslated as <i>Against Nature</i>), removes himself from society—viewing it as the product of a nature long surpassed by human ingenuity—and surrounds himself exclusively with art,perfume, literature, and technology.</p>

          <p>For many years, biological scientists have sought to decipher cellular function byquantifying the degrees of protein and mRNA expression within populations of their cells ofinterest. Classically, these measurements required combining many cells into a single sampleand rupturing their membranes, thus exposing pooled quantities of the target molecule for detection. One limitation of these techniques is the reliance on average measurements: it isimpossible to distinguish a uniform population of cells expressing intermediate quantities ofa molecule from a population composed of separate low and high expressers.

Much of the wording in the second statement—“it is impossible to distinguish a uniform population of cells expressing intermediate quantities of a molecule”—is lifted from a sentence in the first paragraph, talking about classical methods—not the newer, single-celled measurement technologies. Finally, the second paragraph states that flow cytometry and RNA FISH have “made it possible to capture … the distribution of the molecule’s expression within the population,” which is a good match for the wording in the third statement.</p>

The beginning of the passage concerns Portugal taking over Angola over a period beginning in the 16th century and culminating in the 1920s, so eliminate choice (D). The passage refers to “Angolan independence in 1975”—since that date is during the 20th century, choice (E) is out.

          <p>The Portuguese began to enter Angola in the 16th century, and over the next threehundred years slowly pushed into the interior of the sizable nation located in Southern Africa,finally achieving complete occupation by the 1920s. Following Angolan independence in 1975,and despite a bloody civil war that lasted until 2002, the Angolan economy has grown at a double-digit pace since the 1990s, due largely to expansive mineral and petroleum reserves.Conversely, Portugal is now broke and in debt, its economy shrinking by full percentage pointsevery year. In a grand stroke of irony, Portugal’s Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho in 2011suggested to Angola’s President Jose Eduardo dos Santos that “We should take advantageof this moment … to strengthen our bilateral relations.” President dos Santos replied, “We are aware of Portugal’s difficulties and we are open and available to help.” This “help” willlikely come in the form of Angola’s investment in Portuguese industries that the InternationalMonetary Fund has ordered be privatized as a condition of a 78 billion dollar bailout. Already,the country that once mined Angola for slaves and raw material is now virtually helpless asAngola purchases Lisbon’s prime real estate, using much of it to build luxury resorts where Angolan officials go for holidays.</p>
          <p>Despite the stunning reversal of fortune, Angola is not without its difficulties. Corruptionis rampant, and Angola has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world—in thecapital city of Luanda, hamburgers go for 50 dollars and designer jeans cost twice what they doin London or New York, while two-thirds of the population lives on less than 2 dollars a day.</p>

            <p>(E)The dollar value of the worker’s account upon retirement</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="D">
            <p>49. <b>(D).</b> The argument presents two retirement account options. In the first, taxes are paid when money is withdrawn upon retirement; in the second, taxes are paid when the money is initially deposited into the account. The author assumes that it is better to pay taxes on the contributions than on the withdrawals because the amount contributed will be smaller than the amount available for withdrawal. However, the amount paid in taxes, whether on contributions or withdrawals, depends on both the amount of money contributed or withdrawn and on the tax rates applied to those contributions or withdrawals. Thus, to evaluate the argument, it would be helpful to know the amounts of money involved and the relevant tax rates.</p>
            <p>(A) It would be useful to know both the amount contributed and the value of the account upon retirement. Knowing just the first figure, however, does not allow the worker to figure out which retirement account option would result in a smaller tax bill.</p>
            <p>(B) It might be useful to know when and how the tax rates would increase, but “in the future” is too vague. The tax rates may increase while the worker is still employed, or not until the worker has retired. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn concerning which plan is the better option.</p>
            <p>(C) This choice provides no information about the tax consequences, which are the focus of the conclusion.</p>
            <p><b>(D) CORRECT.</b> If a worker knows the relative tax brackets to expect during the different stages, he or she can better predict whether it would be less expensive to pay taxes on the contributions or on the withdrawals.</p>
            <p>(E) It would be useful to know both how much is contributed and the value of the account upon retirement. Knowing just the second figure, however, does not allow the worker to figure out which retirement account option would result in a smaller tax bill.</p>

        <div id="passage5" class="passage">
          <p> One retirement account option allows a worker to save money without paying taxes, but requires the worker to pay taxes on funds withdrawn from the account upon retirement. A second option requires the worker to pay taxes upfront, but allows the worker to withdraw funds tax-free upon retirement. Assuming that the total amount available in the worker’s retirement account at retirement is higher than the total amount contributed prior to retirement, workers can expect to pay less in taxes overall if they choose the second option.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>50. <b>(C).</b> The argument presents a discrepancy between the percentage of survey respondents who reported that they voted in an election (71%) and the percentage of eligible voters who did vote in that election (60%). An explanation of a GRE discrepancy explains why the apparent conflict does not apply.</p>
            <p>(A) If the margin of error is ± 5%, then the 71% figure could be as low as 66% (or as high as 76%). This accounts for less than half of the discrepancy between 71% and 60%.</p>
            <p>(B) This choice does not address the stated discrepancy between the percentage of voters who said that they voted and the percentage of voters who actually did vote. No information is given concerning residency requirements so this information is irrelevant.</p>
            <p><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> One explanation for the discrepancy between these two results is the possibility that people who do vote will respond to surveys at a higher rate than people who do not vote; in other words, people who do vote are overrepresented in the survey’s results. This is an additional premise that would explain the higher percentage of individuals polled indicating that they voted.</p>
            <p>(D) While this may be true, the poll did not ask people if they intended to vote; rather, it asked people if they had already voted in a past election.</p>
            <p>(E) While this may account for some percentage of the discrepancy, the numerical data is not sufficient to explain the entire discrepancy; “some” means “at least one.” In addition, the confused people would not necessarily have responded that they did vote (when thinking about a different election) even though they did not vote in the national election. They could just as easily have reported that they did not vote (when thinking about a different election) even though they did vote in the national election.</p>
