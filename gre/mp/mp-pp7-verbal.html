            <p>The beauty pageant contestant told the judges she wanted world peace, but her suggestion to bring about world peace was _________—apparently, she naïvely thinks everyone could just be told to “love one another” and all the world’s disagreements would fade away.</p>

            <p>37. <b>Facile.</b> The sentence suggests that the idea of bringing about world peace by saying “love one another” is naïve, or oversimplified. “Facile” matches well and has the sense of superficial. Neither “convoluted” (difficult to understand, complicated) nor “impeccable” (flawless) fit the desired meaning. “Amicable,” which means friendly, and “dulcet,” which means sweet and soothing, have a similar problem: while the suggestion might be a friendly and sweet one, those definitions don’t properly convey the idea that the suggestion is naïve.</p>

            <p>38. <b>Garrulous.</b> A “euphemism” is a mild or indirect term substituted for one considered too harsh or blunt. Adults referred to the girl with the positive word “precocious,” which means forward or advanced for her age, whereas she really was “overly talkative,” so the blank should mean something like too talkative, or garrulous. “Skittish” could be cast as positive (excitable) or negative (unpredicable, jittery), but neither is a negative spin on “forward” nor “talkative.” The other choices are either neutral, such as “naïve,” meaning innocent or unworldly, or positive, such as “solicitous” (concerned or attentive) and “endearing” (lovable or charming). None of these choices would require a euphemistic replacement. “Impudent,” then, is the correct choice.</p>

            <p>39. <b>Motley, even, sole.</b> This question is an excellent lesson in the principle: <i>don’t add anything to your reading of the sentence that wasn’t there already.</i> The sentence indicates that the first short story collection had many diverse voices and the second collection has “a ________ narrator”—in other words, just one speaker. The word “sole” fits the third blank; neither “lonely” nor “disingenuous” convey the idea of a single narrator. The first story collection was a “hodgepodge” (jumble), but the second was not a jumble; it was an “even” set of stories. “Insightful” and “facetious” (not serious) are not antonyms for a jumble. For the first blank, “motley” works because it means composed of diverse and often incongruous elements. “Variable” is a trap: a variable hodgepodge of voices would imply that the voices in the first collection can change over time, not that the voices were varied or diverse. And “homogenous” would indicate that the voices were all similar; this describes the second collection, not the first.</p>

            <p>40. <b>Reversing.</b> The opening words, “In contrast,” alert you to look for the opposition between “environmental economics” and “ecological economics.” The latter field “positions the human economy as a subsystem of natural economies,” which is the opposite of a system that “subordinates” nature to the economy. The new system is opposite, or “reversing,” the way the old system thought of things. “Corroborating” is a reversal trap for those who missed “in contrast.” “Circumscribing” means to enclose or encircle and is thus inappropriate. “Ameliorating” is the process of mitigating or making better and is not a good match. “Refuting,” a spin trap, is the most tempting incorrect answer, but the sentence only provides evidence for opposition, not contradiction.</p>

            <p>41. <b>Efficacious.</b> Because the semicolon indicates agreement, the blank will agree with “opponents were still able to set aside differences and work across party lines, as is typically necessary to pass productive legislation.” In other words, political opponents were once able to govern effectively despite their differences but they can no longer do so today. “Efficacious” means effective as a means or remedy and so is a good match. “Polemical,” meaning strongly opinionated, and “civil” are not justified by the clue. “Enjoyable” and “immutable,” meaning unchangeable, do not match the desired meaning. Note that “enjoyable” introduces a new idea not present in the original sentence. Don’t assume that the old days were necessarily enjoyable; all you know is that they were effective, or efficacious.</p>

            <p>42. <b>Deification, garlands.</b> The straightforward structure and positive spin indicate positive choices for both blanks. “Excoriation” means harsh criticism and is the opposite tone of what the sentence requires. “Praise” is positive but doesn’t match the clue “laid at the altar,” which suggests a more extreme version of a positive word. That leaves the correct answer, “deification” for blank (i). The second blank has two words with negatives meanings: “calumnies” means slander and “obloquies” means abusive language. That leaves “garlands,” the correct answer, a word that is most commonly used to describe a wreath of flowers and leaves worn as an honorable décoration, but can also mean a prize or distinction.</p>

            <p>37. <b>Comical, farcical.</b> The “children’s attempt at a Mother’s Day brunch” went pretty badly—so badly that it actually made more work for Mom. What a joke! Correct choices “comical” and “farcical” both mean laughable. The brunch was not “satirical,” because it was not making fun of a preexisting work of art, situation, etc. Although the brunch likely was “convivial” and “amiable,” which both mean warm and good-humored, this pair doesn’t fit with the idea of children creating a minor disaster while trying to do something nice for their mother. “Labile,” which can mean unstable or moody, is used to describe a person or a chemical reaction, not a brunch.</p>

The correct answers, “inscrutable” and “unreadable,” although not perfect synonyms for each other, also both mean difficult to comprehend or understand. “Decipherable” and “lucid,” meaning clear and understandable, are the opposite of what the blank requires. “Sanctioned,” which in this context means officially approved of, and “repetitive” are not synonyms for hard to read and so cannot be correct.</p>

            <p>39. <b>Pacific, conciliatory</b> The opening “Though” foreshadows a twist. The sentence means that although the novel describes “the heroism and sacrifice of the common soldier,” it is “profoundly _________,” where the blank is something that would be unexpected in a novel about brave soldiers. The sentence also says that the novel was banned because it “implicitly opposed,” or was against, “their vision of armed conquest.” Therefore, it must have an anti-armed conquest theme, something peaceful. “Pacific” and “conciliatory,” which both mean anti-war, are the correct answers. “Prescient,” “clairvoyant,” and “prophetic” all mean able to foresee the future, a trap related to the Nazis’s “vision of armed conquest.” The sentence isn’t talking about a supernatural vision, but rather about an overarching goal. It is true that “prophetic” can also mean “characteristic of prophets,” and many prophets in various religious traditions spoke out against what they saw as evil governments. However, the interpretation of “prophetic” as “resisting evil authority” is not what is found as even a secondary definition in standard dictionaries. More importantly, even if you accepted this definition, there is no synonymous or near-synonymous partner among the answer choices. Sentence Equivalence questions require two answers that produce equivalent sentences. Only “pacific” and “conciliatory” work.</p>

Trap answer “defiled” does not appropriately describe an action (you could defile a holy place by doing something very inappropriate, but for a place or thing to be defiled, it should be very pure beforehand.) “Glorious” and “triumphant” do not match the idea that the executive was “disgraced.” “Boorish,” which means ill-mannered, is incorrect because it doesn’t have a match.</p>

Note trap answer “wallowing” (indulging oneself)—only a person or animal can wallow (and anyone wallowing wouldn’t want to regain favor anyway). “Stoic” and “brave” are used to describe people who calmly face danger or hardship, but do not fit the idea that the company is in a “scandal.” “Besotted,” which means infatuated, has the wrong meaning and no match.</p>

Thus,the rich turn to the mechanism of the social contract to shore up the holdings Rousseau viewsas “hoarded.” The concept of a social contract is appealing to the poor, because the poor feardeath in a state of lawlessness and thus seek protection. To obtain assent to the contract, the rich focus their rhetoric on a seeming equality of obligation by creating rules that apply equallyto all members of society. This system, however, simply systematizes the “theft” the rich hadperpetrated on the poor in the pre-law state of nature. the sovereign. Rather than members of the state surrendering their rights to another person—anirrational course of action tantamount to surrendering oneself into slavery—they surrendertheir right to all members of the society and thus to no one. Rousseau refers to this sovereignas the “general will” and it has the task of legislating for the new civil society that is created inthe contract. Unlike early social contract theories, Rousseau’s version conceives of property rightsthat allow for rights of first occupancy to justify claims, rather than rights of the strongest.In this system, property can be taken only if it has not been previously occupied and only to thedegree necessary for the subsistence of those taking it, measures intended as a check tothe hoarding of property by force enshrined in earlier contract theory.</p>

            <p>49. <b>(B).</b> Choice (A) is incorrect because the passage states that “[i]n a state of nature … the rich would have great difficulty protecting the property that they possess.” Even if the rich were to lose their property, nothing indicates that this property would end up evenly distributed among everyone. Choice (B) is correct because this is precisely what the sentence cited above says. Choices (C), (D), and (E) are wrong because they point to Rousseau’s vision for a perfect society, rather than a pre-law society.</p>

            <p>50. “To obtain assent to the contract, the rich focus their rhetoric on a seeming equality of obligation by creating rules that apply equally to all members of society.” This sentence from the second paragraph shows the mechanism by which the wealthy are able to convince the poor to agree to a social contract that will allow them to be defrauded.

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>15. <b>(A).</b> According to the argument, “mold is almost always found in places where there is substantial moisture,” so therefore, to avoid mold and the resultant mold poisoning, people should take steps to prevent wet areas. This argument assumes that wet areas occur first, causing mold to grow. Conversely, this assumption requires that the mold growth itself does not occur first, creating wet areas as a result.</p>
            <p><b>(A) CORRECT.</b> The argument depends on the assumption that the reason mold and wetness are observed together is that wet areas cause mold growth. If the reverse causation (mold causes wetness) were true, then keeping all plumbing in good condition to prevent leakage would do little to prevent the growth of mold. This choice eliminates the alternative causation.</p>
            <p>(B) The argument does not specify or assume that homeowners cannot hire experts to check their plumbing.</p>
            <p>(C) Even if mold could grow in dry areas, the fact that mold is almost always found in wet areas is still valid. This is the fact upon which the argument is based, so the argument does not depend on the unnecessarily absolute assertion that mold cannot grow in dry areas.</p>
            <p>(D) Even if some varieties of mold are harmless, the conclusion of this argument, that “one should make sure to keep all internal plumbing in good condition to prevent leakage” and minimize mold growth, could still be valid. Therefore, this argument does not depend on the unnecessarily absolute assertion that no varieties of mold are harmless.</p>
            <p>(E) Whether mold spores can be filtered from the air may be relevant to a conclusion about the health effects of mold in the home, but it is not directly relevant to the given conclusion.</p>

          <p> Every year, many people become ill because of airborne mold spores in their homes. After someone becomes ill, specialists are often hired to eradicate the mold.

          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>16. <b>(D).</b> This argument discusses a plan with the stated goal “to prevent overcrowding.” Two points of view are represented in the argument: one is that of the town zoning board, the originators of the plan, and the other is that of critics of the plan. The question asks for information that would most support the claims of the critics of the plan.</p>
            <p>(A) How other towns fared under similar zoning plans is irrelevant to this argument, unless additional information was presented to connect the situation of this town to those. There is no such connecting information, so this choice neither strengthens nor weakens either point of view.</p>
            <p>(B) How long it has been since the construction of the last school in town is irrelevant to this argument. The argument addresses methods to prevent overcrowding, an issue that is not directly related to school construction.</p>
            <p>(C) The argument never mentions property taxes, so how property taxes in this town compare to those in neighboring towns is irrelevant.</p>
            <p><b>(D) CORRECT.</b> The argument states that “the town zoning board limited the number of new buildings that can be constructed in the town in any given year.” The goal of this plan is to prevent overcrowding, but only does so indirectly: the town zoning board plan limits the number of new buildings, except for apartment buildings. If many new residents move into town, then the strain on town services will not decrease and may, in fact, increase.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>17. <b>(C).</b> The conclusion of the argument is that “the retail price of chocolate is certain to increase within six months.” This claim is based on the fact that the wholesale price of cocoa solids and cocoa butter has increased significantly and is likely to stay high. The argument assumes that the retail price of chocolate is driven by the wholesale price of cocoa and ignores the cost of the other ingredients in chocolate. To evaluate the conclusion of the argument, it is necessary to examine whether this assumption is valid.</p>
            <p>(A) The price of cocoa solids and cocoa butter during other periods of poor harvest is irrelevant. There is no guarantee that the market for chocolate would respond the same way in this case.</p>
            <p>(B) The willingness of consumers to spend more for chocolate is irrelevant when evaluating whether chocolate will be more expensive due to a shortage of cocoa beans.</p>
            <p><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> If the price of other ingredients in the chocolate has dropped, then the decrease could offset the higher price of cocoa, and the retail price of chocolate could remain steady.</p>
            <p>(D) The percentage of cacao trees affected by the fungus is irrelevant. Regardless of the percentage, it would not change the fact stated by the argument that “there was an unusually meager harvest of cocoa beans this year.”</p>
            <p>(E) It may seem useful to determine whether the fungus can be eliminated within the next six months. However, the conclusion was not about the fungus or the cacao crop, but rather the retail price of chocolate. The time frame for the elimination of the fungus would only be relevant to the short-term retail price of chocolate if you make several additional assumptions: that the harvest immediately increases, that the resulting glut of cocoa beans immediately offsets the “unusually meager harvest of cocoa beans this year,” that the wholesale price of cocoa immediately drops to its pre-fungus level, and that the retail price would not be affected in the meantime. You cannot make all of these assumptions, so the answer to this question is irrelevant to the conclusion.</p>

          <p> Because of a rare type of fungus that killed off many cacao trees in Brazil, there was an unusually meager harvest of cacao beans this year.
