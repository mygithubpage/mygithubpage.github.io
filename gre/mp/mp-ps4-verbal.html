            <p>When assessing a passage’s organization, consider the main idea of each paragraph. This passage begins by noting that “archaeological discoveries frequently undermine accepted ideas, giving rise to new theories.” It supports this statement by relating the impact of one discovery in the field. Thus, the best answer will reference both the overall contention and the use of the example.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>This choice omits the phenomenon that the discovery is meant to illustrate: discoveries often give rise to new theories. Also, there is nothing controversial about the described discovery.</li>
              <li>The passage does not focus on the contrast between previous theories of human development and current theories. Rather, it discusses a singular discovery that affects previous theories. The passage would need to outline both previous and current theories of development and then contrast them. Instead, the passage focuses on how one example illustrates a way in which the field of archaeology evolves.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> The passage makes a general claim and uses a specific example to support that claim, just as this choice states.</li>
              <li>One might feel that the evolution of theories of human development is a worthwhile object of contemplation, but the <i>passage</i><span> does not argue for the importance of archaeology as a field of study. This answer choice misstates the organization of the passage. </span></li>
              <li>The passage does not indicate how popular the earlier theories of human development were. Also, the passage provides only one example of a single discovery and its importance. The language employed in the passage does not warrant describing the passage as a refutation of past theories. </li>

          <h3>Passage D: Fossils</h3>
          <p>Archaeological discoveries frequently undermine accepted ideas, giving rise to new theories. Recently, a set of 3.3-million-year-old fossils, the remains of the earliest well-preserved child ever found, were discovered in Ethiopia. Estimated to be 3 years old at death, the female child was of the <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> species, a human ancestor that lived in Africa over 3 million years ago. “Her completeness, antiquity, and age at death make this find of unprecedented importance in the history of paleo-anthropology,” said Zeresenay Alemseged, a noted paleo-anthropologist, opining that the discovery could reconfigure conceptions about early humans’ capacities.</p>
          <p>Previously, <i>afarensis</i> was believed to have abandoned arboreal habitats. However, while the new fossil’s lower limbs support the view of an upright stance, its gorilla-like arms suggest that <i>afarensis</i> was still able to swing through trees, initiating a reexamination of long-held theories of early human development. Also, the presence of a hyoid bone, a rarely preserved larynx bone that supports throat muscles, has dramatically affected concepts of the origin of speech. Although primitive and more ape-like than human-like, this fossil hyoid is the first found in such an early human-related species.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>The fourth sentence of the first paragraph cites a quotation from a noted paleo-anthropologist that the find of the child fossils was of unprecedented importance due to the child’s “age at death.” Therefore, the fact that the remains were those of a child was of substantial significance.</li>
              <li>The “antiquity”(a synonym for <i>age</i>) of the fossils is mentioned in the fourth sentence of the first paragraph as a reason why the fossils were an important discovery.</li>

                <b>CORRECT.</b> The location of the fossil discovery is mentioned in the first paragraph of the passage. However, the location is not provided as a reason why the fossils are significant.</li>
              <li>This choice is tricky. The second paragraph describes what was previously “believed” about <i>afarensis</i> and that this evidence “dramatically affected” certain theories about the development of speech in humans. The fossils were of a “human-related species,” so the species itself was significant in influencing the theories about human speech.</li>
              <li>The fourth sentence of the first paragraph notes that the find was important due its “completeness.” The intact nature of the fossils is another way of saying that the fossils are complete.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>The passage gives no information about the linguistic capacities of <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> The passage does not give enough information to infer that the species was capable of speech.</li>
              <li>The passage indicates that the discovered hyoid bone more closely resembles those of apes than humans. However, while the passage does generally relate to evolution, the discovered bone is not necessarily less primitive than that of an ape. It could be slightly different in an equally primitive way; not all differences in structure would make a bone more advanced. </li>
              <li>While it can be inferred that this bone has some effect on speech, the passage does not indicate that it is “necessary for speech.” It is possible that a species could be capable of speech without a hyoid bone.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT. </b>The passage states that the discovery of the hyoid bone “has dramatically affected concepts of the origin of speech.” Thus, it can be inferred that the discovery made the reexamination of prior theories necessary.</li>

            <p>The first boldface statement dismisses the government’s plan; as such, it is in support of the analyst’s conclusion. Label it with an S. The second boldface directly supports the analyst’s proposal; it is also an S.</p>

                <b>CORRECT. </b>The first statement does undermine the alternative proposal made by the government. The second statement does support the analyst’s conclusion by showing one way in which better governance might lead to a population increase.</li>

          <p>Political Analyst: After a coalition of states operating under a repressive regime collapsed, some hoped that freedom would bolster the population of the largest state, Algan, but as a result of dislocation and insecurity, the Algan population continues to dwindle at the rate of 700,000 a year. The government proposes to address the problem with a wide range of financial incentives, along with investments in improved healthcare, road safety, and the like. These are positive measures, but <b>they have been tried before, to little avail</b>.

            </p>
            <p>The words “weaken” and “if true” indicate that this is a Weaken the Conclusion question. Find the conclusion and look for an answer that makes this conclusion at least a little less likely to be valid. Note that the question stem specifically references the conclusion of the “consumer advocates.”</p>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b>
            </p>
            <p>One set of notes might look like this:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>D: 3D goods → cust want → &gt; profits</li>
              <li>CA: bad, accident</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The company, Displayco, points out the potential benefits of its new technology: increased profits for the stores. The advocates, though, point out a possible negative effect: shopping cart accidents. Note that the advocates don’t deny that stores will increase their profits; rather, they offer other reasons for avoiding use of the technology. At the least, then, the advocates assume their concerns outweigh the possible benefits of increased profits.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: State the Goal</b>
            </p>
            <p>Find an answer that makes the advocates’ conclusion at least a little less likely to be valid. Use the S-W-slash technique to eliminate answers.</p>
            <p><b>Step 4: Work from Wrong to Right</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Slash/Strengthen. This answer choice may weaken Displayco’s claim that the stores will have better profits; if anything, this would strengthen the advocates’ argument. This choice does not influence whether patrons will find the displays intrusive and distracting.</li>
              <li> Slash. The potential adoption of holographic displays by other venues does not impact the concerns of consumer advocates that the displays will be intrusive and distracting. It could be the case that holographic displays will be intrusive and distracting in all of these other venues as well. Alternatively, the argument might not apply to other venues where there might not be potential for minor shopping cart accidents. </li>
              <li> Slash. One might think that this answer choice would weaken the consumer advocates’ argument. However, the consumer advocates’ argument did not claim that the minor accidents would result in injury. Minor accidents can be bothersome to patrons without causing injury.</li>
              <li> Slash. While this choice might help Displayco to convince supermarkets to use its product, you were asked to weaken the consumer advocates’ concerns. The struggles of supermarkets to achieve profitability is not relevant to the consumer advocates’ specific concerns.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> If studies in test markets have shown that patrons quickly become accustomed to holographic displays, then patrons are much less likely to find the displays intrusive after an initial adjustment period. Further, if patrons become used to the displays, the displays are less likely to increase the frequency of minor accidents involving shopping carts. Note that this choice does not completely dismiss the advocates’ concerns; rather, the concerns are diminished just a little bit.</li>

            <b> patois, jargon</b>
            <p> This sentence is describing rebellion as the effect of a communication gap, which you will need to make concrete with the blank. Something “protean” (meaning “tending to change frequently or easily”) is being compared to the “older generation’s calcified language.” Actually, the best fill-in for your blank is simply <i>language</i></p>
            <p><i>Defiance</i> and <i>insubordination</i> are an incorrect pair, both meaning something like “disobedience.” <i>Prolixity</i> and <i>verbosity</i> are another incorrect pair, which introduces a theme trap, as both words mean “wordiness.”</p>

            <p> “Cantankerous” means “bad-tempered and argumentative.” Because there is no reversal signal here, you simply need a word that means those things. A good fill-in for the blank would be <i>arguing</i> or <i>complaining</i></p>

            <p> In this sentence, you need to figure out what kind of thing would result in the police being called—likely, some kind of <i>crime</i> or <i>fight</i></p>
            <p><i>Discourse </i>and <i>colloquy </i>are an incorrect pair, both meaning “conversation.” <i>Battle</i> may be close to what you want, but relates to a larger event than a bar fight. <i>Mutiny </i>(open rebellion against authorities) is not related to the others.</p>

            <b> eclectic, multifarious</b>
            <p> In this sentence, the word “surprisingly” is functioning as a kind of reversal signal, disagreeing with the portion before the comma. There, you learn that the woman in question had a “sheltered upbringing” and a “limited breadth of experience.” Your blank should be the opposite of that. A good fill-in would be <i>varied</i> or <i>not limited</i></p>
            <p><i>Shallow</i> and <i>facile</i> are an incorrect pair, in that both can mean “superficial.” <i>Profound</i> has the right spin, but it isn’t the opposite of “limited” or “sheltered.” <i>Callow</i> (immature or inexperienced) has no relationship with the other choices, and it incorrectly agrees with “limited breadth of experience.”</p>

            <p> The word “but” acts as a signal to reverse course here, taking you in the opposite direction of the adjectives initially used to define documentary filmmakers: “dispassionate” and objective.” A good fill-in would be <i>speak out</i></p>
            <p><i>Advertise </i>(draw attention to publicly in order to promote sales),<i> inveigle </i>(win, or win over, by flattery), <i>strain </i>(make a strenuous effort), and<i> aspirate </i>(pronounce a sound in the exhalation of breath) have no relationship. Note that <i>inveigle</i> is <i>not</i> the same as <i>inveigh</i> (which does not appear as a choice but would have been a suitable correct answer, as it means “express angry disapproval”—the GRE sometimes plays on commonly confused words).</p>

The second part is the way he’s described as using “the language of food to describe films.” So you want two words that are positive and that could also be used to describe food.</p>
            <p><i>Spectacular</i> and <i>stupefying</i> are an incorrect pair. They are both positive, but they aren’t generally used to describe food. <i>Insipid</i> (bland, tasteless, or flavorless) and <i>brilliant</i> have no relationship, and <i>insipid</i> is the opposite of what is needed in the blank.</p>
