            <p>25. <b>Finishing, trying.</b> Since the novel will take “innumerable hours to review and edit,” the author is far from completing, or “finishing,” it. “Inscribing” (writing) is a theme trap and “rejecting” does not convey the desired meaning. The second blank will agree with the clue that immediately follows: “the book’s length” and its “convoluted plot.” Therefore, it will be hard, or “trying,” to finish the book. “Hardy” (strong, resilient) and “redundant” do not match the required meaning.</p>

            <p>26. <b>Inveigle.</b> The word “despite” indicates that there is a contrast between what the salesman is attempting to do and how the couple is responding. The salesman is attempting to give them false compliments in order to get the couple to buy a car, but his tactic isn’t working. “Inveigle” means to flatter or charm someone into doing something and is the correct answer. “Support,” “deliberate,” “marginalize” (relegate to an unimportant position), and “hector” (to bully, torment) do not convey this same meaning.</p>

The sentence needs a similar word for how war influences her poetry. “Inform”—to give substance, character, or distinction to—can be used in this way. “Mimic” is a trap answer choice: it may be possible to say that her poetry mimics her experiences, but not that her experiences mimic her poetry (rather, her experiences are mimicked in her poetry). “Invalidate” is too strong for this sentence nor does it indicate the proper meaning. “Defer” is not used properly (something defers <i>to</i> something else) nor would war likely defer to poetry. And “presage,” which means to foreshadow, does not pair with color as well as “inform” does.</p>

Neither “coltish” (playful) nor “cumbersome” (complicated, hard to handle) fix the meaning of the sentence. The sentence states that the child finds diving even more frightening than water in general, so “chary of ” (suspicious or slightly scared of), a less extreme version of frightening, fits. “Repulsed by” is too strong of a word for blank (ii) and “beguiled by” would mean the child was deceived by the water.</p>

            <p>30. <b>Sentries, fecund, progeny.</b> The sentence states that solider ants guard the colony and supply it with food, “thus acting as both _________ and laborers.” In this sentence pattern, the first blank matches up with “guard the colony” and “laborers” matches up with “supply it with food.” “Sentries,” or guards, matches perfectly and is the correct word for blank (i). A “sage” is a wise scholar and a “sycophant” is a lackey or flatterer, neither of which fits the meaning of the sentence. The sentence then states that the queen can continually “populate the colony,” so “fecund” (fertile) goes in blank (ii) and progeny (offspring) goes in blank (iii). “Efficacious” means effective and “imperius” means domineering, but the sentence does not indicate that this would describe the queen ant. “Forebears” means ancestors, which is the opposite of what blank (iii) requires. Finally, “harbingers” means a herald or a forerunner of something else, but producing signs of something else would not help to populate a colony.</p>

            <p>25. <b>Depict, mirror.</b> The image of people with “small waists” is contrasted with that of people in “overweight Western societies.” The word “not” before the blank indicates that the blank should mean represent or portray. To “mirror” means to “depict” or portray, and thus both correct answers are good matches. “Distort” is a trap answer, because although an image can be distorted, the sentence is not saying that modern people are distorted. “Denigrate” and “defame” are both very strong words that mean to criticize or disparage, but there is no criticism of modern people in this sentence, just a comparison. “Deify,” which means to treat as godlike, neither has a match nor fits the meaning of the sentence.</p>

            <p>26. <b>Novel, fresh.</b> The sentence says the commentator “parroted his ideological compatriots,” people who think the same way that he does; his commentary was the same as theirs. However, “anything but” reverses the direction, so if his commentary was the same as someone else’s, it was anything but “novel” or “fresh,” the correct answers. If something is “tendentious,” it is intended to promote a particular viewpoint, so that is not the right answer. Although “evenhanded” is tempting, it cannot be the correct answer because it does not have a good match. “Derivative” and “hackneyed” form an incorrect trap pair; both of these words mean imitative or unoriginal, the opposite of what the blank requires.</p>

The correct answers, “putative” (generally thought to be) and “conjectural” (hypothetical, speculative) both match this meaning. “Corroborated” and “irrefutable” are an incorrect pair of words that have meanings similar to “proven.” “Incorrect” could also be seen as an opposite of “proven,” but it does not have a match (and note that an unproven theory is not necessarily wrong). “Irreconcilable,” which means incompatible or conflicting, also cannot be correct because it neither has a match nor fits the intended meaning.</p>

            <p>28. <b>A reviewer for, an overseer to.</b> The sentence says that “no one submitted a construction project proposal if another expressed concerns.” Each of the engineers could look over a proposal before submission, and thereby act as “an overseer to” the others. The only other option that gives that same meaning is “a reviewer for,” since reviewers check for issues. “A go between for” and “a negotiator for” are an incorrect pair, since there is nothing in the sentence that suggests that the engineers negotiate with each other. A “hindrance to” is tempting but has a negative spin, and there is nothing in the sentence suggesting that the relationship is negative. Similarly, “an estimator for” is attractive because construction project proposals involve estimates, but the second part of the sentence says that the issue was only whether other engineers “expressed concerns” about project feasibility or cost estimates. It does not say that the engineers performed each others’ cost estimates, so “an estimator” is going too far.</p>

          <p>As queen of France, Marie Antoinette suffered what were likely the harshest criticismsever laid against any queen or mistress in France’s long history. There were two major factorsthat combined to propagate this dark new level of acidic criticism—one was the bloomingpublic sphere, and the second was the scandalous “Diamond Necklace Affair.” Literacy rose greatly over the course of the 18th century and, not coincidentally, theannual output of printed publications tripled by the end of Louis XV’s reign and expandedexponentially throughout Louis XVI’s kingship. Royal censorship had also been greatly reducedby this time, and a massive “black market” for books and extremely popular undergroundpublications flourished during this period. Also, coffeehouse culture and print culture collided during the mid-to-late 1700s, giving Parisians open forums in which to share the gossips andcriticisms circulating via the underground pamphlets. climber named Rohan and a prostitute named Nicole Leguay met in the gardens of Versailles.Nicole was a stunning look-alike of Marie Antoinette, and she was indeed believed to be thequeen by Rohan that night. To get on Marie’s good side—a necessary evil for anyone withsocial ambitions at Versailles—Rohan was led to believe that if he procured a fabulouslybejeweled necklace on her behalf, it would be a great favor. The scam was revealed when jewelers Boehmer and Bossange inquired directly to MarieAntoinette over payment for the grandiose diamond necklace. They presented her with aninvoice that she had apparently signed (though it was actually a clever forgery). The queen wasfurious and had Rohan arrested and marched off to the Bastille. Yet, in addition to the countlessaristocrats who sued to the king on Rohan’s behalf, at one point over 10,000 people came to the doors of the Bastille demanding Rohan’s release. He was eventually acquitted, much to thequeen’s dismay. France was incredibly damaging to the queen’s already blackened reputation. Furthermore,as this hatred of the queen began to boil over, it became inevitable that it would spill ontothe monarchy itself. Though Marie would always be the ultimate villainess, she could never becompletely untangled from Louis and, thus, from the monarchy itself. She was not a mistresswho could be surreptitiously cut away or a political advisor who could be dismissed. She was a queen, and this fact had inescapable consequences.</p>

          <p>In John D’Emilio’s essay “Capitalism and Gay Identity,” D’Emilio argues that the emergenceof industrial capitalism led to new opportunities for “free laborers” in the United States, leadingto various beneficial changes in social conditions. The overarching themes emerge fromD’Emilio’s argument about the effects of the onset of industrial capitalism: the new abundance of independence, and choice for “free laborers.” He implies throughout that these—independenceand choice—are the distinct new markers of the social conditions resultant fromthis economic shift. that he largely sidesteps the problems that confound free labor ideology and limit the abilityof workers to openly negotiate contracts with employers and to accept or reject the conditionsoffered. The “contract negotiations” cited as a sign of freedom by D’Emilio are often hardlynegotiations at all, but rather highly exploitative arrangements that workers have little abilityto affect. From the first Lowell Girls all the way to the modern third world garment workers described by Enloe’s “Blue Jeans and Bankers,” it is clear that for many—particularly women,minorities, and immigrants—free labor has hardly been free at all. housekeeping, to even the “home-based jobs” described in “Blue Jeans and Bankers,” labor isstill a very active part of the home even today. capitalism equated to freedom from the home, Davis argues that it actually equated tothickening the bars that caged housewives to the home as productive and reproductive laborsplit further and more distinctly apart. Davis argues that women “were the losers in a double-sense:as their traditional jobs were usurped by the burgeoning factories, the entire economymoved away from the home, leaving many women largely bereft of significant economic roles.”</p>

Choice (C) is correct because Davis argues that women “were the losers in a double-sense … leaving many women largely bereft of significant economic roles.” If being “bereft” of an economic role makes one a “loser,” it is not going too far (in fact, it is less extreme) to say that “[p]eople without economic roles are disadvantaged.” Choice (A) is wrong as it is an opinion of D’Emilio’s mentioned in the first paragraph. Choice (B) is wrong as it is an opinion of Enloe’s mentioned in the second paragraph.

The passage does not state, however, whether Congress also ensured that condition 2 would be met.

            <p>(E)Obtaining energy from nonrenewable sources, such as gas, oil and coal, cannot be made less risky.</p>

            <p>12. <b>(C).</b> The conclusion of the argument is that renewable sources of energy, chiefly solar and wind, will be less risky for certain utilities than nonrenewable sources, such as oil and gas. The basis for this claim is that the renewable sources will provide stable, low-cost supplies of energy, whereas the prices for nonrenewable sources will fluctuate according to availability. You are asked to find an assumption underlying this argument. For this argument to be valid, it must in fact be true that these renewable sources of energy will provide stable, low-cost supplies.</p>
            <p>(A) The utility companies’ claim has to do with the supply risk of the new energy sources, not with how these sources are received by the public. Thus, this choice is irrelevant.</p>
            <p>(B) If no new supplies of traditional energy sources are found, then it is true that perhaps these nonrenewable supplies will continue to fluctuate in price in a risky manner. However, the argument does not depend upon any assumption about the future discovery of oil and gas supplies.</p>
            <p><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> If it is assumed that weather patterns are consistent and predictable, then with the stated premises, the conclusion that solar and wind power will be less risky than oil and gas follows. If, on the other hand, weather patterns are not consistent and predictable, then solar and wind power are not reliable and thus will not “provide stable energy supplies at low cost.” Therefore, the argument’s conclusion directly depends on this assumption.</p>
            <p>(D) To reach the required conclusion that renewable sources of energy, chiefly solar and wind, will be less risky for certain utilities than nonrenewable sources, it is not necessary to assume that the conversion technology for new sources is not more expensive than the present technology.</p>
            <p>(E) This choice does not directly affect the argument. Whether energy produced through combustion can be made less risky is irrelevant; the new energy sources might still be less risky than the older sources.</p>

          <p> In response to the increasing cost of producing energy through traditional means, such as combustion, many utility companies have begun investing in renewable energy sources, chiefly wind and solar power, hoping someday to rely on them completely and thus lower energy costs.

As a result, these sources will be less risky for the utilities than nonrenewable sources, such as gas, oil, and coal, whose prices can fluctuate dramatically according to availability.</p>
