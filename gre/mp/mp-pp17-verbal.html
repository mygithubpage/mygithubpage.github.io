            <p>97. <b>Tacky, discerning, tactically.</b> The judgmental mind behind this sentence finds his grandmother’s décor “vulgar,” so the first blank should be a synonym for that. “Tacky” fits the bill. Neither “vitreous” (made from glass) or “grizzled” (having gray hair) can reasonably describe the grandmother’s décorating scheme. The second blank should be something like appropriate: it wouldn’t be appropriate to tell his grandma what he really thinks. Neither “rancorous” (malevolent) or “doting” (to lavish attention on) fits this meaning. “Discerning,” meaning having or showing good judgment or shrewd, fits perfectly. For the third blank, you need a word that describes being nice to someone in order to get a good birthday present. “Amicable” doesn’t capture the strategy of the idea, but “duplicitous” is way too negative. It means deceitful, which is not really an apt description for the act of refraining from telling your grandma that she has terrible taste. “Tactically,” meaning by way of showing adroit planning, is correct.</p>

            <p>98. <b>Warded off, mutiny.</b> The second half of the sentence says that the crew became frustrated and “decided to take matters into their own hands,” implying that they took over the ship. “Mutiny” fits perfectly. (A “sea change” is a profound transformation, while “helmsmanship” relates to helmsman, a person who steers a ship.) For the first blank, you need a word implying that the captain tried to fight off the mutiny. “Dissuading” is tempting, but it is something you can do only to people (e.g., I dissuaded the pirates from mutinying). “Warded off” means fended off or averted, which is perfect here. “Depreciated” (to cause to decrease in value) has the wrong meaning.</p>

            <p>99. <b>Serendipitous, dispensations.</b> A “birth lottery” is offered as an example of the sort of element the first word describes. Since a lottery is random, based on chance, the first blank should be something like due to luck, and that is just what “serendipitous” means. Be careful of the trap answer “common.” Although “common element” is a frequently used expression, it does not capture the correct meaning, which is random. “Inchoate” (incipient, only partially in existence) is a good GRE word, but it has the wrong meaning. The second blank looks to be roughly synonymous with gifts. “Dispensations” will work there, while “encumbrances” and “piques” are both negative.</p>

            <p>100. <b>Discriminate, baseless.</b> The mantis shrimp has more color detecting cells than any other creature. “While one would think” indicates that the common or logical view will turn out to be incorrect. Certainly the logical deduction would be that these shrimp are good at seeing colors, so “discriminate” (which can mean to distinguish accurately) is the best choice for the first blank. The GRE will often use lesser known secondary meanings, as here with “discriminate.” “Distort” is a reversal trap and “improve” does not fit the desired meaning. The second blank should contrast what “one would think.” It turns out that they can’t actually see more colors, so this claim is false, or “baseless” (without basis in fact). “Obvious” and “illiberal” (narrow-minded) do not mean false.</p>

            <p>101. <b>Detractors, vulgar.</b> “While” indicates that the clause after the comma will oppose the clause before the comma. So instead of supporters, you want opposers. The word “condemned” further hints that the first blank will be something like opposers/condemners. Only “detractors” works. “Interlocutors” (go-betweens) and “contemporaries” (people who lived at the same time) do not fit the desired meaning. For the second blank, you want a description that a detractor would apply to “earthy speech.” So you want earthy, but in a bad way—perhaps coarse or unrefined would serve. The word “vulgar” fits those descriptions. “Obtuse” (unintelligent or ignorant) is negative but does not match the clue “earthy.” In contrast, “genteel” (polite) is almost the opposite of what you want.</p>

            <p>102. <b>Versatile, explicate.</b> The first blank doesn’t offer much of a clue, beyond the idea that the tools are “sophisticated” (and therefore positive). “Versatile” is the best fit. “Eclectic” (drawing from multiple sources) is neutral, not positive. “Populist” (a member of a political party claiming to represent the interests of the common people) is tricky because it looks similar to popular. Next, the social scientists are using these tools “to model and help _________ even decisions.” “Explicate” (explain) is the best match. “Interpolate” means to estimate an intermediate point between two known points, or to insert new words into a text; decisions cannot be interpolated. Similarly, decisions cannot be extended by assuming that existing trends will continue, so “extrapolate” doesn’t fit either.</p>

            <p>97. <b>Melancholy, morose.</b> The key to this sentence comes at the very end, when the sentence says that Hamlet is not “paralyzed with depression,” or generally depressed. “Indecisive” and “monologic” both fit the famous character of Hamlet, but they don’t fit the sentence (nor do they make a pair). Similarly, “violent” and “barbaric” would be accurate in describing someone who committed a “killing spree,” but they don’t fit the blank.

            <p>98. <b>Anomalous, aberrant.</b> The word “once” signals a change in the direction of meaning. As the sentence ends with the idea that the behaviors in question “were once considered normal,” you need something for the blank that means uncommon. “Mythical” and “fabulous” may seem to fit, but they’re too extreme. “Anomalous” and “aberrant,” which both mean deviating from an expected standard, fit. “Importunate,” meaning persistent, may rhyme with “unfortunate,” but that’s about all they have in common.</p>

The blank needs to contrast with “the fantastical.” “Mundane” and “quotidian” are the correct answer pair. “Cosmopolitan” means cultured or glamorous and is the opposite of what the sentence requires. “Bombastic” and “belletristic,” both of which mean pompous or ostentatious, do not contrast with “fantastical.” Finally, “literary” is a trap since a novel is a piece of literature.</p>

It would be necessary to get right to the most important part of the issue. “Conclusion” and “culmination” are a pair, but they mean the end, which isn’t quite right. “Pith” and “gist” (the essence of something) are a much better match for the blank. “Apex,” or climax, and “genesis,” or beginning, not only do not form a pair, but also do not fit the meaning.</p>

In fact, he wrote a “complex and beautiful symphony” at the young age of 16, which suggests he is a prodigy, or child genius. “Precocious,” meaning advanced for his age, and “exceptional,” or extraordinary, are good descriptions for a child prodigy. “Musical” is a tempting answer, but the word doesn’t have anything to do with his cleverness, nor does it have a matching answer choice. “Monastic” and “hermetic” might appeal as answer choices, due to his “reclusive” nature, but they do not fit with other clues in the sentence.

The much milder pair, “acknowledge” and “allow,” doesn’t fit because their intensity doesn’t match that of “argues.” “Immolate” is a great GRE vocabulary word that means to burn as a sacrifice, which, although interesting, is definitely not the desired meaning here. “Decry” is another great word that means to publicly denounce, but it also does not fit.</p>

          <p>After 22 years of observations in Shark Bay, Australia, behavioral biologist Janet Mannand her colleagues have discovered that certain bottlenose dolphins, known as spongers,form social networks, showing the first hints of culture among non-human animals. Spongersare dolphins that wear marine basket sponges on their beaks as hunting tools, using them to root around on deep sandy bottoms and find fish concealed below the sand. Sponging is acomplex hunting technique passed on from mother to offspring. A sponger must know wherethe sponges grow, how to pick the right sponge, how to remove the sponge intact from theocean floor, and how and where to properly hunt. emerged. The 28 female spongers formed cliques with other female spongers that were notnecessarily genetically related to them. This behavior differs from other animal behavior wherecircumstances, such as genetics or food sources, dictate the formation of groups. The fact thatthese spongers chose to associate based upon similar, socially learned behaviors makes theircliques a cultural first among animals.</p>

          <p>For years, the idea that blind people can hear better than sighted people was consideredsomething of an old canard. However, functional brain imaging now has allowed us tolook inside the brains of blind people who possess what can only be termed cerebralsuperpowers—the ability to understand speech at up to 25 syllables per second, a speed that sounds like “noise” to sighted people (a typical sighted person understands closer to 10syllables per second). As it turns out, a brain region called V1, situated at the back of the skulland which normally only responds to light has actually been rewired in the brains of blindpeople—and now processes auditory information. This is truly a stunning example of thebrain’s plasticity, a topic of cardinal importance in designing educational experiences and materials to best engage the brains of students. and that our intellect, personality, and selfhood are attributable to physical processes in thebrain and can be altered by brain injuries.</p>

Far less known, however, arethe mass deportations that took place almost two years after the conclusion of the war, thistime orchestrated by the Allied governments. In the years after 1945, over 12 million German-speaking citizens of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Poland were dispossessed, packedinto trains, and left to fend for themselves in a newly defeated and impoverished Germany.What allowed for this mass exile—the largest forced migration in history—was the confluenceof political motivations on the part of the key players. The expelling countries of Eastern andCentral Europe were especially keen on punishing Germans for the horrors of the war—though, of course, their own German-speaking populations were hardly responsible for Germany’sactions—and on increasing the ethnic homogeneity within their borders. The Allied powers,too, had something to gain. The Soviet Union, intent on capitalizing politically on Germany’sdefeat, aimed to irrevocably undermine relations between Germany and Poland, especially byceding German territory to Poland and emptying it of its inhabitants. Britain, weary from the war, hoped the resulting mass suffering would reinforce the completeness of Germany’s defeat.And the United States, in turn, was attempting to cozy up to the nations of Eastern and CentralEurope in the hopes of keeping them away from Soviet influence. country. The death toll was not far worse, furthermore, only because the Soviets’ ambition tocripple Germany was unsuccessful. Following the war, Germany underwent what is known asits “economic miracle,” which made it possible to house, feed, and employ the mass of exiles.That this episode is practically excised from the history books in some countries, however, issurely corroboration of the platitude that history is written by the victors.</p>

          <p> Celiac disease results from an inability of the digestive tract, specifically the small intestine, to absorb gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and certain other grains.

          </div>
          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)While languages differ in their number of basic color terms, no language has been conclusively determined to have more than 11 such terms.</p>
            <p>(B)Every language contains mechanisms by which speakers who perceive subtle differences in hue can describe those differences.</p>
            <p>(C)Among cultures employing only three color terms, the word red typically encompasses not only objects that would be called red in English but also those that would be called yellow.</p>
            <p>(D)Several languages, such as Vietnamese and Pashto, use a single term to mean both blue and green, but speakers of such languages commonly refer to tree leaves or the sky to resolve ambiguous utterances.</p>
            <p>(E)In a study of native speakers of Tarahumara, a language that does not distinguish between blue and green, respondents were less able to identify distinctions among blue and green chips than native speakers of Spanish, which does distinguish between blue and green.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>42. <b>(E).</b> This argument proposes that culture does not influence the process by which the mind distinguishes colored objects. In support of the conclusion, the argument notes that all languages with six color terms name the same colors, as do all languages with three color terms. To weaken the conclusion, the correct choice will support the counter argument that culture does influence how the mind distinguishes colored objects. Notice the logical difference between distinguishing color names and distinguishing colored objects. For instance, a speaker of English can visually distinguish two objects with different shades of red, even if he or she cannot easily name the difference. Some of the wrong answers attempt to confuse these two processes.</p>
            <p>(A) Irrelevant. It may be interesting to observe that no language has more than 11 basic color terms. However, this observation neither weakens nor strengthens the argument that culture influences how the mind perceives color variations.</p>
            <p>(B) Irrelevant. In fact, this statement may slightly strengthen the argument: if every language permits speakers to describe subtle color variations, then it might be argued that human color perception is independent of language, since language would then not be “boxing in” the speaker.</p>
            <p>(C) Irrelevant. The term red may encompass both red and yellow, but that doesn’t mean that speakers of the language cannot see the difference between red and yellow. In the same way, the English word blue covers many shades that English speakers with normal vision can distinguish (sky blue, royal blue, etc.).</p>
            <p>(D) Strengthens. If speakers of languages without a blue–green distinction refer to the sky or tree leaves to clarify their meaning, then they obviously see a difference between the sky and tree leaves. Using the sky or tree leaves as reference points is no different from using fruit names for colors (e.g., orange, peach). This evidence reinforces the idea that humans have a common basis for perceiving colors.</p>
            <p><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> If Tarahumara speakers are less able to identify differences between blue and green objects than Spanish speakers, then it can be argued that the lack of a blue–green distinction in the Tarahumara language influences how Tarahumara speakers actually perceive colors. It should be noted that this evidence does not completely prove the point—the causality could actually work the other way (e.g., Tarahumarans could share a genetic defect that causes blue–green color blindness, and so they never developed a distinction in their language). Also, if the experiment is not well designed, the difficulty in identification could simply come from the lack of a handy term to capture the difference between blue and green. However, the evidence as given does support the hypothesis that culture influences color perception.</p>

          <p> All languages that have exactly six basic color terms describe the same six colors—black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow—corresponding to the primary neural responses revealed in studies of human color perception. In addition, all languages that have only three basic color terms distinguish among black, white, and red. This evidence shows that the way in which the mind recognizes differences among colored objects is not influenced by culture.</p>
