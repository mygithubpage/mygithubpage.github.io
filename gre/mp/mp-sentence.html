Instead, the story took some kind of “turn”—meaning that it changed in some way—and “admonished readers to always be honest.” That is, it took a turn by talking about morals or prescribing correct behavior.</p></div></div></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>2.   Floodwaters had already breached the library's walls, but hopeful volunteers in hip boots worked tirelessly to __________ the damage.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>mitigate</p><p>exacerbate</p><p>abase</p><p>bolster</p><p>forestall</p><p>flummox</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">2. <b>Mitigate, Forestall</b>. That “floodwaters had already breached the library's walls” sounds very bad—the water is already inside. The pivot “but” tells you that the sentence is going to change direction, and indeed, the volunteers are “hopeful,” so you're looking for something good in the blank—although it doesn't seem like they're going to cure the problem entirely. A good fill-in would be something like “limit” or “hold back.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question3" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>3.   The candidate campaigned on a platform of willingness to cooperate with the members of other political parties, yet many commentators were nevertheless surprised that he indeed turned out to be less _______________ than his predecessor.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>irate</p><p>divisive</p><p>impulsive</p><p>wily</p><p>infuriated</p><p>combative</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">3. <b>Divisive, Combative.</b> The most important words here are the pivots “nevertheless surprised” and “indeed,” which tell you that the candidate actually stayed true to his campaign promise. That means he acted cooperatively, which is contrasted with the actions of his predecessor. A good fill-in would be “uncooperative.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question4" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>4.   When Sven got angry, whether it was during an argument with his family or with just a coworker, it proved almost impossible to _____________ him and thereby return him to his normal demeanor.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>condemn</p><p>pacify</p><p>judge</p><p>incense</p><p>mollify</p><p>influence</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">4. <b>Pacify, Mollify.</b> This sentence provides the clues that when Steve “got angry,” returning him “to his normal demeanor” was “almost impossible.” His normal demeanor must be something like “not angry,” so you're looking for something like the verb “calm” in the blank.</p></div></div></div><div id="question5" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>5.   The graduate student's experiment yielded results as surprising as they were promising; her next step was to pursue additional data that would ____________ her findings.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>undergird</p><p>buttress</p><p>gainsay</p><p>undermine</p><p>eschew</p><p>lecture</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AB"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">5. <b>Undergird, Buttress.</b> The target is both the data and the findings—the blank contains what the data will do to the findings. You have the clue that the results were promising (but surprising, indicating some uncertainty about the apparent conclusion), and you have a same-direction pivot (the semicolon). Thus, her next step would likely be to “verify” or “corroborate” the findings.</p></div></div></div><div id="question6" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>6.   There is no fundamental difference between a person who quietly ___________ a bigoted viewpoint to a friend and one who spews chauvinist vitriol on television.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>eschews</p><p>espouses</p><p>professes</p><p>denies</p><p>reneges</p><p>substantiates</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">6. <b>Espouses, Professes.</b> This sentence originally posits that there is “no fundamental difference” between two things, but the overall point is that the two things do look different on the surface. That means you want someone who does the opposite of “spews chauvinist vitriol on television,” such as someone who quietly “expresses” it. A good fill-in would be “communicates.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question7" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>7.   A 1957 lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture regarding aerial pesticide spraying was the ___________ for Rachel Carson to begin the writing of her environmentalist manifesto <i>Silent Spring</i>, though she had become concerned about and started researching the practice years earlier.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>stimulus</p><p>conspiracy</p><p>atrocity</p><p>impetus</p><p>catastrophe</p><p>climate</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AD"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">7. <b>Stimulus, Impetus.</b> Prior to 1957, Rachel Carson was already concerned about aerial pesticide spraying, but the lawsuit caused her to begin work on the book. A good fill-in would be “inspiration.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question8" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>8.   A commentator with a more _____________ worldview would not find it so easy to divide up the nation into good guys and bad guys.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>belligerent</p><p>subtle</p><p>philosophical</p><p>aberrant</p><p>peaceful</p><p>nuanced</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">8. <b>Subtle, Nuanced.</b> In this sentence, the commentator is described as finding it easy to split people into “good…and bad” categories. This is a very simplistic way of looking at the world. Someone with a more complex worldview would be unlikely to break things down so simplistically.</p></div></div></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>9.   James Joyce's <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>, written in a stream of consciousness style full of convoluted puns and obscure allusions, has a deserved reputation for linguistic ___________ .</p></div><div class="choices"><p>caprice</p><p>opacity</p><p>meaninglessness</p><p>informality</p><p>uniqueness</p><p>inscrutability</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">9. <b>Opacity, Inscrutability.</b> Joyce's book is described as “stream of consciousness,” with “convoluted puns and obscure allusions.” The adjectives “convoluted” and “obscure” are the most important part of this sentence. They tell you that the novel is likely hard to understand. A good fill-in would be “difficulty” (specifically, of understanding).</p></div></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>10. The financial situation in many European nations is _______________ enough that even a small incident could lead to catastrophe.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>drab</p><p>unstable</p><p>illegitimate</p><p>unsafe</p><p>precarious</p><p>churlish</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">10. <b>Unstable, Precarious</b>. The situation in Europe is described as bad enough that even a small incident might lead to a catastrophe. This means that everything is on the brink of disaster. You could fill in the blank with something like “shaky.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>11. While the argument for global warming may not be _______________ by the record low temperatures reported this year, this data does not undermine the overall trend of steadily higher global temperatures.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>bolstered</p><p>fortified</p><p>subverted</p><p>defined</p><p>supplanted</p><p>subordinated</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AB"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">11. <b>Bolstered, Fortified</b>. The second half of this sentence is not relevant to the blank. All you need to notice is the contrast between “warming” and “record low temperatures” as well as the pivot “while.” Clearly, record low temperatures would not help an argument about global warming. A good fill-in would be “helped.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>12. The debate coach expected some gravitas from her team, arguing that pithy quips and gibes, while sometimes effective, had no place in a _______________ argument.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>polite</p><p>shallow</p><p>competitive</p><p>serious</p><p>cantankerous</p><p>substantive</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">12. <b>Serious, Substantive</b>. The debate coach values “gravitas” (seriousness) and argues that “quips” (witty remarks) and “gibes” (taunts) don't belong in a certain kind of argument. “Serious” and “substantive” is the only set that works.</p></div></div></div><div id="question13" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>13. Last year it was discovered that <i>South Park</i> writers ______________ part of its <i>Inception</i> spoof from a similar <i>College Humor</i> sketch.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>amalgamated</p><p>filched</p><p>indulged</p><p>combined</p><p>poached</p><p>assumed</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">13. <b>Filched, Poached</b>. The most important word here is the adjective “similar.” If both <b>South Park</b> and <b>College Humor</b> created a similar spoof, then one of them must have “stolen” the sketch from the other.</p></div></div></div><div id="question14" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>14. Some critics view Abstract Expressionism, which is characterized by geometric shapes and swathes of color, as a _______________ of realist painting.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>rejection</p><p>manifestation</p><p>renunciation</p><p>memento</p><p>commemoration</p><p>vindication</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">14. <b>Rejection, Renunciation.</b> Abstract Expressionism is described as “characterized by geometric shapes and swathes of color.” Clearly this is very different from “realist painting.” A good fill-in would thus be something like “repudiation,” which means a rejection or a refusal to deal with something.</p></div></div></div><div id="question15" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>15. The nascent United States’ first spy, Nathan Hale, was captured by the British when he attempted to ______________ British-controlled New York City to track enemy troop movements.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>thwart</p><p>penetrate</p><p>infiltrate</p><p>permeate</p><p>research</p><p>conquer</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">15. <b>Penetrate, Infiltrate</b>. You are told that Nathan Hale was a spy working for the nascent (coming into being) United States, and that he was captured by the British. That means he must have been involved in some kind of espionage in “British-controlled” New York. A good fill-in would be “break into.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question16" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>16. Romantic comedies of the 1950s were characterized more by sexual ______________ than the straightforward vulgarity that characterizes dialogue in today's “rom-coms.”</p></div><div class="choices"><p>conversation</p><p>blatancy</p><p>insinuation</p><p>illusion</p><p>innuendo</p><p>rapport</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="CE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">16. <b>Insinuation, Innuendo</b>. The pivot “more by X than Y” implies some kind of contrast between the two elements. The second element here is “straightforward vulgarity.” You want to contrast that with something. The adjective “sexual” may seem to confuse things; you need a word that will undercut it, such as “allusion.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question17" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>17. Inflation isn't dead, only _____________; as the economy turns around, the purchasing power of the dollar is likely to fall again.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>paralyzed</p><p>dormant</p><p>indigent</p><p>itinerant</p><p>problematic</p><p>inactive</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">17. <b>Dormant, Inactive.</b> The blank is there to describe “inflation” (in a way that contrasts with being entirely “dead”). You're told that in the future, the purchasing power of the dollar may fall, which means there will be inflation. So inflation may come back at any time. A good fill-in would be something like “dormant” (there aren't a lot of simple words that get across this meaning).</p></div></div></div><div id="question18" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>18. Some boxers talk about trying to access their more _____________ selves in order to counter the fact that civilized people generally don't punch each other in the face.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>seething</p><p>barbaric</p><p>irate</p><p>insidious</p><p>dynamic</p><p>primitive</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">18. <b>Barbaric, Primitive</b>. Boxers are described as having to punch each other in the face, which isn't “civilized.” In order to do this, they would need to access a part of themselves that was “not so civilized” (which will work well enough as a fill-in here).</p></div></div></div><div id="question19" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>19. Many people assume that creative work is less _______________ than manual labor, but they underestimate the difficulty of being entirely self-motivated (as well as writing one's own paychecks).</p></div><div class="choices"><p>inventive</p><p>collaborative</p><p>serious</p><p>arduous</p><p>taxing</p><p>grave</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">19. <b>Arduous, Taxing</b>. This sentence describes creative work as having a particular difficulty, namely that one must be “self-motivated.” Some might contrast this with manual labor, but the author of the sentence wants to render them equivalent. Thus, a good fill-in would be “difficult.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question20" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>20. The education debate is only getting more _______________ as politicians demonize teachers unions and every special interest group jumps into the fray.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>vehement</p><p>overt</p><p>heated</p><p>problematic</p><p>tired</p><p>unavoidable</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">20. <b>Vehement, Heated</b>. If politicians “demonize” teachers unions and other jump into the “fray,” the debate will get more and more “passionately angry,” a good fill-in here.</p></div></div></div><div id="question21" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>1.   While many individual religions insist on the primacy of their particular deity, syncretism advocates the ______________ of multiple religious beliefs, attempting to reconcile even opposing principles and practices.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>exclusion</p><p>marriage</p><p>commingling</p><p>division</p><p>transgression</p><p>schism</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">1. <b>Marriage, Commingling.</b> This sentence begins with the pivot “while,” before describing religions that “insist on the primacy of their particular deity.” “Syncretism” is then introduced as relating in some way to “multiple religious beliefs.” Because of the opening pivot, you know syncretism should be in favor of multiple religious beliefs. The fill-in is something like “inclusion” or “mixture.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question22" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>2.   The ambassador was invested with ____________ power by his government and hence was able to draft and finalize the agreement unilaterally, without first consulting with even the president.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>tertiary</p><p>consummate</p><p>enigmatic</p><p>tyrannical</p><p>complete</p><p>dictatorial</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">2. <b>Consummate, Complete.</b> The target is the ambassador's power. You have a same-direction pivot (“hence”), and the clue is that, due to this power, he “was able to draft and finalize the agreement unilaterally” (seems like a lot of power for a diplomat). A good fill-in would be something like “a lot of” or “total.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question23" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>3.   Sometimes it seems that today's politicians will exploit any opportunity to ______________ their views to the world, no matter how sordid or partisan.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>declaim</p><p>invoke</p><p>disparage</p><p>parrot</p><p>adduce</p><p>trumpet</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">3. <b>Declaim, Trumpet.</b> The portion of this sentence after the comma is not actually relevant to the blank. All you need to determine is what most politicians do in regards to “their views.” Clearly, they like to “proclaim” or “announce” those views.</p></div></div></div><div id="question24" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>4.   The many chapters of the organization decided that a mandatory national ______________ would be necessary to reconcile what had become a haphazard and often chaotic set of bylaws and regulations.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>introduction</p><p>acclamation</p><p>intervention</p><p>colloquium</p><p>symposium</p><p>mediation</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">4. <b>Colloquium, Symposium.</b> The sentence tells you that the organization has somehow acquired a “haphazard and often chaotic set of bylaws and regulations.” Thus, it is likely that they will want to get everyone together in order to reconcile all these rules. A good fill-in would be “meeting.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question25" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>5.   Though it seems implausible that one could be a great writer without some experience of life, many famous authors have led a ______________ and solitary existence.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>idiosyncratic</p><p>cloistered</p><p>susceptible</p><p>enigmatic</p><p>sheltered</p><p>cryptic</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">5. <b>Cloistered, Sheltered.</b> The pivot word “though” tells you that you are going to contradict the first portion of this sentence, which says that writers ought to have “some experience of life.” Your blank should go against that notion, and because you already have “solitary,” a good fill-in word would be “protected.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question26" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>6.   Though he wasn't particularly well-known as a humanitarian, his deep sense of responsibility for those who were suffering was real, and was belied by an outward appearance of _________________ .</p></div><div class="choices"><p>concern</p><p>sagacity</p><p>mirth</p><p>felicity</p><p>nonchalance</p><p>indifference</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="EF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">6. <b>Nonchalance, Indifference.</b> In this sentence, the key is the word “belie,” which functions as a kind of pivot. “Belie” means “to misrepresent or contradict,” suggesting a contrast to “his deep sense of responsibility.” A good fill-in for the blank would be “not caring.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question27" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>7.   Excessive patriotism is by definition _________________ , as the elevation of one country to the rank of quintessential on Earth necessarily requires some amount of demonization of other people.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>minatory</p><p>xenophobic</p><p>unethical</p><p>bigoted</p><p>nationalistic</p><p>truculent</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BD"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">7. <b>Xenophobic, Bigoted.</b> The blank here is defined by the second half of the sentence. Patriotism represents the “elevation of one country to the rank of quintessential on earth,” that is, saying or believing that one country is the epitome or purest example among all countries on earth. So your blank should be something that involves the “demonization of other people.” A good fill-in would be “prejudiced.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question28" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>8.   One possible explanation for the mandatory debauchery of most bachelor parties is that if the husband-to-be is able to practice _______________ in those circumstances, he must be ready for marriage.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>forbearance</p><p>gentility</p><p>fiat</p><p>tenacity</p><p>temperance</p><p>autonomy</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">8. <b>Forbearance, Temperance.</b> It's important to know the word “debauchery” (meaning “excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures”) to solve this question. The sentence describes a husband-to-be who will <b>not</b> be engaging in debauchery at the bachelor party, so you need a word that describes someone who exhibits “self-control” or “moderation.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question29" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>9.   Jon Stewart's “Rally to Restore Sanity” was purportedly organized to prove that it was possible to discuss politics humorously but civilly, without ______________ those on the other side of the fence.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>bespeaking</p><p>eulogizing</p><p>lampooning</p><p>vilifying</p><p>caricaturing</p><p>maligning</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">9. <b>Vilifying, Maligning.</b> The rally here is described as discussing politics “humorously but civilly, without” doing the thing in the blank. A good fill-in for the blank would be “abusing” or “badmouthing.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question30" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>10. Though occasionally used in practice, very few forms of corporal punishment have been ______________ by the military, due less to the Geneva Conventions than to the overwhelmingly negative popular response to reports of abuse.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>upbraided</p><p>sanctioned</p><p>endorsed</p><p>considered</p><p>rejected</p><p>polarized</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">10. <b>Sanctioned, Endorsed.</b> The second half of this sentence tells you that reports of corporal punishment receive an “overwhelmingly negative popular response.” This means that the military would be unlikely to “authorize” these forms of abuse.</p></div></div></div><div id="question31" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>11. The budget debate progressed well for the first few months, in spite of all the ardent and sometimes bitter squabbling, but slowly descended into a ______________ of competing interests and claims.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>quagmire</p><p>covenant</p><p>feud</p><p>morass</p><p>quarrel</p><p>accord</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AD"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">11. <b>Quagmire, Morass.</b> The first part of the sentence, which describes how the budget debate “progressed well…in spite of…squabbling,” is very important. If you didn't see that, you might be tempted to choose the wrong words here. However, because of the pivot “but,” you want something that contrasts with something that progresses well. A good fill-in would be “mess” or “muddle.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question32" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>12.

Your blank should oppose it, but you don't want the opposite of “subtle” (which would be something like “obvious,” which clearly doesn't make any sense here). Instead, you need to think about the overall meaning of the sentence. Most likely, the point is that the difference between similes and metaphors is “important.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question33" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>13.

You are given two statements about economics. First, that Keynesian economics may or may not recommend that “the limit (on government debt) should be perpetually raised.” Then you are told definitively that Keynes says “deficit spending must be done responsibly.” If the latter is true, then it is <a id="page_122" />likely that he would <b>not</b> have made the former recommendation. So your blank should say something like “incorrect.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question34" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>14.

Something “protean” (meaning “tending to change frequently or easily”) is being compared to the “older generation's calcified language.” Actually, the best fill-in for your blank is simply “language.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question35" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>15.

There, you learn that the woman in question had a “sheltered upbringing” and a “limited breadth of experience.” Your blank should be the opposite of that. A good fill-in would be “varied” or “not limited.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question38" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>18. Many people expect documentary filmmakers to be dispassionate and objective, but Michael Moore has a reputation for never missing a chance to _____________ against those with whom he disagrees.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>rail</p><p>advertise</p><p>fulminate</p><p>inveigle</p><p>strain</p><p>aspirate</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">18. <b>Rail, Fulminate.</b> The word “but” acts as a pivot here, taking you in the opposite direction of the adjectives initially used to define documentary filmmakers: “dispassionate” and “objective.” A good fill-in would be “speak out.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question39" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>19. The movie critic was best remembered for the way he used the language of food to describe films, for example, how he praised Iñarritu's action sequences by comparing them to a _____________ empanada.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>insipid</p><p>spectacular</p><p>brilliant</p><p>piquant</p><p>zesty</p><p>stupefying</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">19. <b>Piquant, Zesty.</b> There are two important portions of this sentence to focus on. First, the word “praised,” implying that the critic's review will be positive. The second part is the way he's described as using “the language of food to describe films.” So you want two words that are positive and that could also be used to describe food.</p></div></div></div><div id="question40" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>20. Every few years, someone manages to survive a skydive with a parachute that doesn't open, often with only a few broken bones, some _______________ , and a gash or two.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>torpor</p><p>trauma</p><p>bruises</p><p>finesse</p><p>lesions</p><p>contusions</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="CF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">20. <b>Bruises, Contusions.</b> In this sentence, a short list of possible injuries after a skydiving accident is described. Two of the items are “broken bones” and “a gash,” which means your blank should be a physical injury different from those two. A good fill-in would be “bruises.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question41" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>1.   As official ____________ from Japan to this country, he was called upon to answer questions about the Japanese government's position on various issues.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>envoy</p><p>tyro</p><p>emissary</p><p>neophyte</p><p>ascetic</p><p>libertine</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">1. <b>Envoy, Emissary.</b> The person in question is serving as “official” something for Japan to another country, and is “called upon to answer questions about the Japanese government's position.” A good fill-in would be something like “representative” or “ambassador.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question42" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>2.   While the group's street protests had had an aggressive, uncompromising tenor, once admitted to the halls of power to begin formal lobbying, its leaders wisely chose to ________ the stridency of their rhetoric.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>metamorphose</p><p>gild</p><p>wane</p><p>palliate</p><p>succor</p><p>damp</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">2. <b>Palliate, Damp.</b> The target is both the leadership and the “stridency of their rhetoric”—you need the relationship between those two things. “While” is an opposite-side pivot. In the first part of the sentence, the protests are “uncompromising.” Thus, in the second part, they should be softer, more on the side of compromising. Since “stridency” means harshness and is on the same side as “uncompromising,” the group thus chose to “reduce” or “tone down” the stridency.</p></div></div></div><div id="question43" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>3.   The women's rights movement has been mostly _____________ in the Middle East, but it is likely that activists will be newly galvanized by the political upheavals currently sweeping the region.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>dogged</p><p>quiescent</p><p>interminable</p><p>lissome</p><p>abeyant</p><p>feckless</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">3. <b>Quiescent, Abeyant.</b> The clue here is that “activists will be newly galvanized.” Because of the pivot “but,” this means you need a blank that means the opposite of “galvanized.” A good fill-in word would be “dormant” (implying that the movement is quiet but could rise again).</p></div></div></div><div id="question44" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>4.   Debate rages on between proponents and detractors of corporal punishment and the death penalty, though even the most ardent supporter agrees that punishments must be _______________ and the justice system evenhanded and thorough.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>equitable</p><p>clement</p><p>delimited</p><p>apposite</p><p>tantamount</p><p>merciful</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AD"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">4. <b>Equitable, Apposite.</b> The first half of this sentence sets up the topic, but the important information is in the second half. There, you're told about the “most ardent supporter [of corporal punishment].” This supporter agrees with detractors on at least one thing, for which “evenhanded and thorough” is a clue. A good fill-in for your blank would be “deserved” or “fair.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question45" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>5.   Peer-reviewed journals are a sacred cow of most scientific rationalists, but studies have shown that the premise of impartiality is ________________ , as results tend to be colored by the personal proclivities and suppositions of the experimenters.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>inane</p><p>prejudicial</p><p>fatuous</p><p>chimerical</p><p>fallible</p><p>vexing</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">5. <b>Chimerical, Fallible.</b> The portion of this sentence after the blank tells you that “results tend to be colored by…personal proclivities and suppositions.” This provides an explanation of the blank, which in turn is trying to tell you something about “impartiality.” That last portion describes something the exact opposite of “impartial,” so a good fill-in for your blank would be “wrong” or “nonexistent.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question46" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>6.   The description of the restaurant as a garden of ______________ delights is fair enough, as Chef Marcel conjures up a menu of texture and taste that calls into question one's preconceived notions of what constitutes a meal.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>salubrious</p><p>epicurean</p><p>carnal</p><p>voluptuous</p><p>terrestrial</p><p>gustatory</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">6. <b>Epicurean, Gustatory.</b> Everything in this sentence relates to food, whether it's the “texture and taste” or the “notion of what constitutes a meal.” This means you need a word that relates to food. A good fill-in would be “culinary.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question47" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>7.   Most of his books drone on and on for chapter after chapter, each one providing yet another example of his thesis, the _____________ of which can be found in précis form in the tome's first few pages, and which is recapitulated from that point on.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>gist</p><p>adage</p><p>pith</p><p>stub</p><p>nimbus</p><p>nut</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AC"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">7. <b>Gist, Pith.</b> The verb “drone” has a very specific meaning, implying that someone is going on at length in a dull or boring way. The implication is that the point could be made more efficiently. This sentence then tells you that a précis (summary) can be found in the tome's first few pages. This précis is really the book's “essence” or “thrust,” which is the kind of word you want for the blank.</p></div></div></div><div id="question48" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>8.   In order to ascertain the efficacy of the new GRE vis-à-vis the old one, it will be necessary not only to collect, but also to _______________ detailed score reports from test-takers from both groups, as only by studying the differences and similarities in results can proper inferences be drawn.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>aggregate</p><p>ratiocinate</p><p>collate</p><p>juxtapose</p><p>agglomerate</p><p>glean</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="CD"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">8. <b>Collate, Juxtapose.</b> The final portion of this sentence describes “studying the differences and similarities” between two different things. This implies you'll be doing some sort of comparison, so a good fill-in word would be “compare.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question49" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>9.   In World War I, trenches were dug so that the soldiers could avoid the near constant _____________ from the other side of the line of battle, but not even a trench could protect a battalion from grenades or aerial bombardment.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>volleys</p><p>provocations</p><p>fervency</p><p>imprecations</p><p>goadings</p><p>salvos</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">9. <b>Volleys, Salvos.</b> The second half of this sentence doesn't tell you anything interesting. In fact, everything you need to know comes from the few words before the blank: “trenches were dug so that soldiers could avoid” something. What would you avoid in a trench? “Bullets,” more or less, or “barrages,” if you wanted to get a little fancier.</p></div></div></div><div id="question50" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>10. Cary Grant's reputation as a suave and _____________ ladies man extended beyond the silver screen to his real life, where he was known to never let a woman pull out her own chair, in keeping with the custom of gentlemen at that time.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>consummate</p><p>genteel</p><p>debonair</p><p>waggish</p><p>courtly</p><p>cosmopolitan</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">10. <b>Genteel, Courtly.</b> Near the beginning of the sentence, Cary Grant is described as suave, meaning “confident and elegant.” Your blank should not mean the exact same thing, or it would be redundant. Instead, you want a word that is best exemplified by someone who always pulls out a woman's chair, such as “well-mannered.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question51" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>11. Focusing primarily on self-awareness, empathy, and honest self-expression, the communication process known as “nonviolent communication” states that the attempt to find parity in a relationship is a fallacious principle, as any notion of fairness is entirely _______________ .</p></div><div class="choices"><p>subjective</p><p>introverted</p><p>pragmatic</p><p>utilitarian</p><p>illicit</p><p>personal</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">11. <b>Subjective, Personal.</b> The sentence states that the attempt to find “parity,” or fairness, is “fallacious,” or logically incorrect. How could fairness be illogical? Only if it isn't real or objectively determinable. A good fill-in would be “prejudiced” or “based on feelings.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question52" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>12. Education has become a kind of albatross in American politics, in that a speech with any hint of _______________ is actually more pernicious to a politician's reputation than one with numerous signs of ignorance, or even outright stupidity.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>bromide</p><p>erudition</p><p>patrimony</p><p>condescension</p><p>cerebrality</p><p>bloviation</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="BE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">12. <b>Erudition, Cerebrality.</b> This sentence compares the blank with speeches that feature “ignorance” and “stupidity.” You also want something that relates to “education.” A good fill-in would be “knowledge,” which is the result of education.</p></div></div></div><div id="question53" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>13. Laurent Cantet's <i>Time Out</i> tells the true story of a man so obsessed with retaining the ________________ of plenitude even after he is discharged from his employment that he doesn't even tell his wife and his kids about his termination.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>corollaries</p><p>paradigms</p><p>semblance</p><p>prepossessions</p><p>veneer</p><p>consequences</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="CE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">13. <b>Semblance, Veneer.</b> In this sentence, you're told about a man who has been fired and doesn't tell his wife and kids. This somehow relates to “plenitude,” which is “the condition of being full or complete.” Clearly, if you get fired and don't tell your family, it's because you want to pretend that you're still okay. A good fill-in word would be “appearance.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question54" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>14. What people fail to remember about Don Juan is that his astronomical number of amatory adventures were due more to his ________________ approach to seduction than any surfeit of charisma or skillfulness.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>sumptuous</p><p>lurid</p><p>covert</p><p>indiscriminate</p><p>blanket</p><p>sybaritic</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">14. <b>Indiscriminate, Blanket</b>. The sentence tells you that Don Juan had “an astronomical number of amatory adventures,” but that it was not because he had a “surfeit of charisma or skillfulness.” What might explain this discrepancy? Perhaps if Don Juan weren't particularly choosy. A good fill-in for the blank would be “not choosy.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question55" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>15. Even the most far-reaching campaign finance reform proposals will fail to_______________ the influence of money, which doesn't just buy speedboats and golf weekends in the Bahamas, but directly relates to a politician's capacity to run for office.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>attenuate</p><p>graft</p><p>pander</p><p>abate</p><p>importune</p><p>indemnify</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AD"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">15. <b>Attenuate, Abate.</b> The sentence indicates that “even” major campaign finance reform will “fail” to do something to “the influence of money.” This money “directly relates” to a politician being able to become a politician, so the influence of money must be pretty strong. Thus, the reform proposals will fail to “lessen” or “reduce” the influence.</p></div></div></div><div id="question56" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>16. In their landmark study of Victorian literature's relationship to feminism, Gilbert and Gubar _____________ the many ways in which 19<sup>th</sup>-century women writers created characters that fit into archetypes of “angel” and “monster.”</p></div><div class="choices"><p>interrogate</p><p>interpolate</p><p>debunk</p><p>limn</p><p>explode</p><p>castigate</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AD"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">16. <b>Interrogate, Limn.</b> There are no pivots in this sentence, so you simply need a word that fits the description of a book that explores the “many ways in which 19<sup>th</sup>-century women writers….” In other words, you can just fill in the blank with “explore.” Note that “interrogate” is being used in a figurative sense here (i.e., it's not referring to a literal interrogation, as of a criminal), though the goal of both types of interrogation is to pry deeply into an issue.</p></div></div></div><div id="question57" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>17. While it's inarguably prejudiced to imply that there is some kind of innate ______________ in certain countries, it's more reasonable to say that certain cultures are more willing to prioritize relaxation and a sense of moderation between work and play.</p></div><div class="choices"><p>obtundity</p><p>enfeeblement</p><p>enervation</p><p>languor</p><p>seemliness</p><p>lethargy</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="DF"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">17. <b>Languor, Lethargy.</b> This sentence creates a contrast with the pivot “while” between a positive and negative view of the same fact. The positive view is that certain cultures prioritize “relaxation” and “moderation between work and play.” The negative view of this would be something akin to “laziness.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question58" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>18.

Autodidacts (“those who teach themselves”) would argue against “enforced” lucubration (study) and “standard” education. A good fill-in might simply be “unnecessary.”</p></div></div></div><div id="question59" data-choice-type="checkbox"><div class="question"><p>19.

Some historians argue that at least in so far as the broad strokes are concerned, cataclysmic events such as the Great Depression are ______________ , due to what some have termed “the inertia of history.”</p></div><div class="choices"><p>ineluctable</p><p>incontrovertible</p><p>interminable</p><p>infallible</p><p>inexorable</p><p>unspeakable</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="AE"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text">20. <b>Ineluctable, Inexorable</b>. The key phrase here is “the inertia of history.” Inertia is “resistance to change,” so this phrase must mean that history is on track and can't deviate from that track. So your blank here should be something like “unchangeable.”</p></div></div></div></div></main></body></html>
