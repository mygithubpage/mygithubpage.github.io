          <h3>Passage C: Life on Mars</h3>
          <p>Because of the proximity and likeness of Mars to Earth, scientists have long speculated about the possibility of life on Mars. Roughly three centuries ago, astronomers observed Martian polar ice caps, and later scientists discovered other similarities to Earth, including length of day and axial tilt. But in 1965, photos taken by the <i>Mariner 4</i> probe revealed a Mars without rivers, oceans, or signs of life. Moreover, in the 1990s, it was discovered that unlike Earth, Mars no longer possessed a substantial global magnetic field, allowing celestial radiation to reach the planet’s surface and solar wind to eliminate much of Mars’s atmosphere over the course of several billion years.</p>
          <p>More recent probes have investigated whether there was once liquid water on Mars. Some scientists believe that the presence of certain geological landforms definitively resolves this question. Others posit that wind erosion or carbon dioxide oceans may be responsible for these formations. Mars rovers <i>Opportunity</i> and <i>Spirit</i>, which landed on Mars in 2004, have both discovered geological evidence of past water activity. These findings substantially bolster claims that there was once life on Mars.</p>

            <p>This passage is primarily concerned with the possibility of life on Mars. The two paragraphs discuss various discoveries that have been made over the past few centuries. The passage concludes that recent findings substantiate claims that there was once life on Mars. However, scientists are still not certain. In determining the purpose or main idea of the passage, you should avoid extreme words and be able to defend every word. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>This passage does not set out to <i>disprove</i> the theory that there is life on Mars. It is also too extreme to suggest that this is a “widely accepted theory.”</li>
              <li>This answer choice is tempting because it is relatively neutral. However, the passage does not seek to initiate a debate; it is more concerned with documenting findings that pertain to life on Mars. In other words, the passage presents the findings that frame a debate; it doesn’t initiate the debate itself.</li>
              <li>The passage presents evidence in support of and against the possibility of life on Mars. It is too limited to suggest that the passage is primarily concerned with presenting evidence “in support of” life on Mars.</li>

                <b>CORRECT.</b> This answer choice avoids extreme words and best summarizes the purpose of the passage.</li>
              <li>This answer choice is too specific. The passage does mention the Mars rovers <i>Opportunity</i> and <i>Spirit</i>, but it is inaccurate to suggest that the passage is primarily concerned with these two rovers.</li>

                <b>CORRECT.</b> The passage does make mention of wind erosion and carbon dioxide oceans, but the author states that these are other possible explanations for certain geological landforms on Mars. Wind erosion and carbon dioxide oceans are <i>possible</i><i>causes</i> of the geological landforms rather than “discoveries.”</li>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>This is a Specific question that refers back to the second sentence in the first paragraph. The best approach is to reread this sentence and determine, using surrounding sentences, what the author’s purpose is in mentioning Mars’s polar ice caps. If you read the second part of the sentence, “later scientists discovered other similarities to Earth, including length of day and axial tilt,” you notice that polar ice caps are introduced as an example of the similarity of Mars to Earth (note the use of the word <i>other</i>).</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The passage does not mention the content of the polar ice caps, just that they were observed.</li>

              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> As stated above, polar ice caps are introduced as one of several similarities of Mars to Earth.</li>

            <p>the claim that there was once water on Mars has only marginal support from recent discoveries</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>A question that asks for an inference from the passage is a Specific question; it is helpful to find evidence for any inference in the text. Make sure each inference can be defended by going back to the text and does not go far beyond the language in the passage.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>In the second paragraph, the author states that while the presence of geological landforms may indicate the presence of water, it is also possible that these landforms were caused by wind erosion or carbon dioxide oceans.</li>
              <li>The first paragraph describes three similarities between Mars and Earth (polar ice caps, length of day, and axial tilt). The passage then contrasts that evidence: “But” later photos showed a planet “without rivers, oceans, or signs of life.” If this later evidence showed no signs of life, in contrast to earlier evidence showing similarities with Earth, then the similarities must support the possibility of life on Mars.</li>
              <li>In the second paragraph, the absence of a substantial global magnetic field is presented as evidence of the lack of life on Mars. Again, note that this answer choice avoids extreme words by using the word <i>suggests</i></li>
              <li>The first sentence in the second paragraph states that “more recent probes have investigated whether there was once liquid water on Mars.” Given this purpose, it is clear that the existence of water is important in order to establish whether or not there was life on Mars.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> According to the second paragraph, the “Mars rovers <i>Opportunity</i> and <i>Spirit</i>… have both discovered geological evidence of past water activity.”As made clear by the subsequent sentence that “these findings substantially bolster claims,” the evidence supporting the claim that there was once water on Mars is substantial. Thus, the passage contradicts the statement that this claim is supported by only marginal evidence. </li>

            <p>Most of the passage is about what aspects of Mars might or might not imply that it once supported life. Seek out direct language in the passage to prove or disprove each possible answer choice.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> The passage says that “Mars no longer possessed a substantial global magnetic field,” which led to the disappearance of Mars’s atmosphere. This dissimilarity with Earth is used in the passage as evidence against life on Mars.</li>
              <li>The passage mentions “carbon dioxide oceans” as a possible cause for certain geological formations. Another possible (and contrasting) cause is liquid water. Since water activity is associated with possible life, and carbon dioxide oceans are mentioned in contrast, carbon dioxide is probably not evidence of life.</li>
              <li>While your general knowledge of the importance of the sun might make it reasonable to assume that the sun would be important on other planets as well, the passage does not discuss this particular issue. The passage does mention “length of day” as a similarity between Mars and the Earth, but length of day does not necessarily mean hours of daylight. A day can also refer to the length of time it takes a planet to rotate on its own axis.</li>

            <p>This Select-in-Passage question asks for evidence that there was not life on Mars at the time that evidence was collected. </p>
            <p>The correct answer probably will not be found in the second paragraph, which mostly provides evidence that there <i>was</i> life on Mars at one point. In the first paragraph, the third sentence says that in 1965, photos<i>“</i>revealed a Mars without rivers, oceans, or signs of life,” providing evidence that life did not exist at that time. The next sentence indicates that the lack of a magnetic field caused some negative consequences incompatible with life. However, this sentence says that there is no longer such a magnetic field, indicating that the field did once exist.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="choices">
            <p> In the last year, the ratio of average apartment rents to average real estate prices has increased in Tuam but fallen in Galway.</p>
            <p> Tuam has experienced a greater shift in demand toward the rental market than Galway has.</p>
            <p> It has become easier for Galway real estate to be bought and sold, whereas it has become easier for Tuam real estate to be rented.</p>
            <p> The supply of rental apartment units has decreased more in Tuam than in Galway.</p>
            <p> The average amount spent on housing is higher in Galway than it is in Tuam.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b>
            </p>
            <p>The word “inference” indicates that this is a Draw a Conclusion/Inference question. Expect to see only premises in the argument.</p>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b>
            </p>
            <p>One set of notes might look like this:</p>
            <p>Past yr: RE $ &gt; 7% in G but 2% in T Avg rent &gt; 4% in G but 8% in T</p>
            <p>Notice two things. First, the argument gives only percentages, not real numbers; you can’t conclude anything that involves real numbers, including where rents or home prices are higher. Second, rents are increasing at a faster rate in Tuam but home prices are increasing at a faster rate in Galway.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: State the Goal</b>
            </p>
            <p>What must be true according to the given information?</p>
            <p><b>Step 4: Work from Wrong to Right</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> While it isn’t possible to conclude anything about real numbers, you can use percentages to determine something about ratios. In Tuam, rents have gone up at a faster rate (8 percent) than have real estate prices (2 percent). Thus, the ratio of average rents to average real estate prices must have grown in that city—the numerator has grown faster than the denominator. In contrast, Galway rents have gone up at a slower rate (4 percent) than real estate prices (7 percent). Thus, the ratio of average rents to average real estate prices has actually decreased. </li>
              <li> It is not necessarily true that Tuam has experienced a greater shift in demand away from buying and toward the rental market; that is only one possible explanation. For instance, the larger increase in Tuam rents could be explained by a reduction in the supply of rental units in Tuam. </li>
              <li> This might be true but does not have to be. The premises do not indicate whether Galway real estate is easier or harder to be bought and sold or whether Tuam real estate is easier or harder to be rented. The premises simply indicate the growth in prices and rents. </li>
              <li> It is not necessarily true that the supply of rental units has decreased more in Tuam than in Galway. For instance, there could be a sudden growth in demand in Tuam for rental units (e.g., because of an influx of young singles who are eager to rent), causing rents to increase more rapidly.</li>
              <li> The premises indicate nothing about the actual amounts of money spent in the two towns. You are given only percentage growth rates.</li>

          <div class="choices">
            <p> Many recreational hunters hunt only once or twice per hunting season, regardless of the length of the season. </p>

            <p>Attempting to decrease the number of deer in his state, a governor extended the recreational hunting season. However, since the reintroduction of the longer hunting season, the number of accidents caused by deer has not declined—instead, it has increased substantially. </p>
            <p><b>Step 3: State the Goal</b>
            </p>
            <p>You need to find the answer choice that explains why the accidents have increased rather than decreased as expected. Perhaps the traffic accidents weren’t caused by deer in the first place. Perhaps the accidents are caused by deer fleeing the hunters, in which case a longer hunting season would probably lead to more accidents.</p>
            <p><b>Step 4: Work from Wrong to Right</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li> If many hunters hunt once or twice per hunting season regardless of the length of the season, then a longer hunting season wouldn’t make a difference to the situation. However, this would not explain the observed <i>increase</i> in accidents. </li>
              <li> If the deer are “easy prey,” then the governor’s extension of the hunting season should be <i>effective</i> in reducing the deer overpopulation. This does not explain the increase in traffic accidents. </li>
              <li> Careful! This does explain how accidents occur but does not explain why there are more accidents this year, after the governor put in place a plan designed to reduce accidents. </li>
              <li> This answer choice would contribute to an explanation of a gradual increase in traffic accidents over the last several years. However, it does not explain a substantial increase in accidents from just last year to this year. Both the extent of the increase and the time frame serve to make this answer choice an unsatisfactory explanation of the observed rise in accidents. </li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> A new highway system recently built directly through the primary habitat of the state’s deer population provides a specific explanation as to why the number of accidents involving deer has increased: more people are driving in the area where deer live. It also explains the time frame of the increase.</li>

            <p> In this sentence, the key is the word “belied,” which functions as a kind of reversal signal. <i>Belie</i> means “to misrepresent or contradict,” suggesting a contrast to “his deep sense of responsibility.” A good fill-in for the blank would be <i>not caring</i></p>
            <p><i>Mirth</i> and <i>felicity</i> are an incorrect pair, both meaning something like “happiness,” though <i>mirth</i> additionally often implies laughter. <i>Concern</i> and <i>sagacity </i>(keen judgment) have no relationship. </p>

            <b> xenophobic, bigoted</b>
            <p> The blank here is defined by the second half of the sentence. “Patriotism” represents the “elevation of one country to the rank of quintessential on Earth,” which implies that one country is the purest example among all countries on Earth. So your blank should be something that involves the “demonization of other people.” A good fill-in would be <i>prejudiced</i></p>
            <p><i>Minatory</i> and <i>truculent</i> are not quite a pair (the former means “threatening,” while the latter means “aggressively defiant”), and <i>unethical</i> and <i>nationalistic</i> have no relationship to each other.

            <p> It’s important to know the word “debauchery” (meaning “excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures”) to solve this question. The sentence describes a husband-to-be who will <i>not</i> be engaging in debauchery at the bachelor party, so you need a word that describes someone who exhibits <i>self-control</i> or <i>moderation</i></p>
            <p><i>Fiat </i>(authoritative decree) and <i>autonomy</i> (the right to self-government; independence)are not quite a pair and are incorrect anyway. <i>Gentility </i>(the state of belonging to polite society; refinement of manner) and <i>tenacity</i> (the quality of being persistent or stubborn)have no relationship.</p>

            <p><i>Lampooning</i> and <i>caricaturing</i> make an incorrect pair, both meaning “mocking or ridiculing,” though <i>caricaturing</i> specifically means to do so by exaggerating particular features or traits. Though they are close to the correct meaning for your blank, the sentence mentions that the rally was “humorous.” This means that <i>lampooning</i> and <i>caricaturing</i>, both of which imply a kind of humorous teasing, would be welcome at the rally, so not plausible for the blank. <i>Bespeaking </i>(suggesting; ordering or reserving something in advance) and <i>eulogizing</i> (to praise highly, especially at a memorial service) have no relationship (and the latter is the opposite of what you want here).</p>
