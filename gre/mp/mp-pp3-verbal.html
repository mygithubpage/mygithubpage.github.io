            <p>13. <b>Proponent, catalyst.</b> The woman in this sentence “finally got the bill onto the legislative agenda,” so she is definitely an advocate, or “proponent,” of the legislation. She’s not a “critic” of the legislation, but she’s also not an “apologist” since there’s no clue in the sentence to believe that the legislation is controversial. In blank (ii), “mercenary” means she would be paid for her efforts and “lackey” means she would be doing this subserviently for someone else. Either option might work if there were additional clues about the subject, but without those clues, “catalyst,” someone who creates change, is the best option and the correct answer.</p>

            <p>15. <b>Acerbic, impecunious.</b> Standing alone, any of the choices for the first blank could describe “witticisms,” which are witty remarks. Remarks could be “innovative” (original or creative), “acerbic” (sharp or sarcastic), or “inimical” (harmful or hostile). However, the remarks are described as “cutting remarks” after the semicolon, so the first blank should match that characterization. “Cutting” is a synonym for “acerbic,” so this is the best choice. “Inimical” is too negative, conflicting with the idea that “Wilde catapulted to sudden fame both because of and despite” his remarks. The second blank is part of a two-part list: “he died __________ and sickly.” The cause is given in the preceding two-part list: “the cutting remarks … led to his financial and physical ruin.” A two-by-two structure like this stays in order, meaning that “financial … ruin” is related to the blank, just as “physical ruin” is related to “sickly.” Only “impecunious,” which means poor or destitute, fits. Neither “pallid” (pale) nor “aghast” (horrified) fits with “financial ruin.”</p>

            <p>16. <b>Emblematic of, pragmatic, posit.</b> The end of the sentence states that Hursthouse puts forth the same views as many other virtue ethicists. So in the first blank, the sentence requires something like representative of. “Emblematic of” is a perfect fit here and the correct answer. “Breaking away from” conveys the opposite meaning and “enigmatic to” (difficult to understand) also does not fit the desired meaning. It’s later stated that Hursthouse thinks ethics is neither situational nor utilitarian—the next part of the sentence will have a first part that matches up with situational and a second part that matches up with utilitarian. (GRE sentences often use a pattern of mentioning two things, and then giving more information about those two things in the same order.) For example, “Base one’s judgments on subjective concerns” refers back to a situational approach to ethics and a “__________ weighing of pain and pleasure” refers back to a utilitarian (or practical) approach. Thus, “pragmatic,” which means practical, matches better than “quixotic,” which means impractical, or “grandiloquent,” which means pretentious. Finally, critics agree with the idea that virtue ethicists seek to enshrine their own prejudices, so in the third blank, the sentence needs a word like say or claim. “Posit” is the only match since “deny” is the opposite of what the sentence intends and “cajole” (persuade) does not fit the context.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="CE">
            <p>17. <b>Roundly, panned.</b> The sentence indicates that there wasn’t a single positive comment from any critic; in other words, the film was unanimously criticized or 100% disliked. “Mendaciously” means dishonestly, and there’s no clue to indicate that the critics were being dishonest. Similarly, there’s no clue in the sentence to suggest that anyone was “warily” suggesting anything. “Roundly” means emphatically or so thoroughly as to leave no doubt. “Panned” means reviewed negatively and is almost always used to refer to plays, movies, etc., so the word is a perfect match here—to be roundly panned would mean reviewed 100% negatively, which is exactly what the sentence suggests. “Lauded” and “venerated” are both positive and would indicate that the critics enjoyed the movie; clearly that’s not the case here.</p>

            <p>18. <b>Aesthetics.</b> The sentence states that “the distinction between architecture and engineering professions” is that architecture must consider something in addition to “functionality.” Later, the sentence indicates that architectural clients base decisions more on beauty than practicality, so architecture must consider visual appeal as well as functionality. The word that best fits this meaning is “aesthetics.” “Insouciance,” meaning carelessness or indifference, does not fit. “Utility,” “price,” and “profundity” are all characteristics that architects might consider, but they don’t take into account the fact that clients base their decisions on beauty.</p>

The pairing “partisan” and “prejudiced” is a trap; the words mean biased and fit with “ideological,” not “pragmatic.” Neither “voluble,” which means talkative, nor “innocuous,” which means harmless, fits the intended meaning.</p>

Although “prurient,” meaning having an excessive interest in sexual matters, might describe a comedy about a “philandering hair dresser,” it doesn’t have an answer match. “Inhibited” and “puritanical” form a pair, but have the wrong meaning—they are too similar to “somber.” Finally, “dated” might be used to describe an old movie, but it doesn’t have a match.</p>

However, “profligate” has a distinctly negative spin (it implies wastefulness) that “prolific” and “fecund” do not have and so does not match them in meaning as well as they match each other. “Prolix” is a trap because it looks similar to “prolific,” but it means tediously lengthy. “Exemplary” and “ingenious” form a tempting wrong answer pair, because the writer’s imagination does appear to be outstanding, but the sentence specifically says that “the quality of her works is far from consistent,” which makes “prolific” and “fecund” much better matches.</p>

While the officials might have been “aggravated” that the explorers returned with too much information, another word with similar meaning doesn’t exist to pair with “aggravated.” “Crushed,” “bored,” and “disappointed” don’t appropriately describe the situation; the explorers brought back even more information than they were originally planning.</p>

If a behavior is not learned, it must be inborn or innate. The correct answers are “prone” and “disposed,” which mean inclined or willing. “Compelled” and “indoctrinated” form a pair that suggests that force or manipulation are used to get people to be xenophobic, which does not fit with the idea of it being an innate behavior. “Taught” cannot be correct because if something is “taught,” it is not innate. “Proven” is a theme trap because scientists often try to prove theories, but it cannot be correct because it does not have a match.</p>

            <p>17. <b>(E).</b> The first paragraph states that “[w]ith no access to mortgages, residents within the red line suffered low property values and landlord abandonment; buildings abandoned by landlords were then more likely to become centers of drug dealing and other crime, thus further lowering property values.” The lack of access to mortgages is due to redlining. Thus, redlining causes landlord abandonment and the resultant effects—(E) is a perfect match. Note that (A) mentions “subprime mortgages” and “defaults,” which are never mentioned in the passage. Choice (B) incorrectly cites reverse redlining rather than redlining. Choice (C) gets the relationship between redlining and landlord abandonment backwards. In Choice (D), “constrained access to health care, jobs, insurance, and more” is not just a potential consequence of reverse redlining; these negatives are mentioned in context with redlining.</p>

The word “only” eliminates the second statement—watch out for extreme language! If just one person outside of the developing world premasticates food for a baby, this statement is false, so it cannot be inferred.

          <p>Premastication is the practice of a mother pre-chewing food before feeding it, mouth-to-mouth,to her baby. While germophobic Western society eschews this practice, it is not onlycommon in the developing world, but provides benefits to a developing baby. Babies are notborn with digestive bacteria; they get some from passing through the birth canal, but continue to encounter the beneficial bacteria during breastfeeding and while being handled, in general,by adults. Throughout most of human history, in fact, babies have received disease-fightingantibodies and digestive bacteria from the mother’s saliva, transmitted via premasticatedfood. In some cultures, fathers also premasticate food for babies; sometimes even entire familygroups will do this—a toddler at a family meal might wander from person to person, being fed by many adults.</p>

          <p>Matisse and Picasso; Picasso and Matisse. Throughout the twentieth century, this pairinghas been touted as the quintessential artistic rivalry. In <i>Matisse and Picasso</i>, Yve-Alain Boisfollows Hubert Damisch in proposing that the interaction between Picasso and Matisse shouldbe seen as a dynamic game rather than a static conflict of artistic polarities. Bois employs the metaphor of chess, arguing that the game represents the artists’ exchange as “a competitiverivalry and a complex temporality” that can be viewed both as a linear process and asimultaneous structure. but also in friendly dialogue. The two men were more than rivals: they were colleagues, critics,teachers, and occasional friends. A better model, though perhaps one with less flash, is thatof a simple conversation, with all the rich variation and shifts in motivation and tone that arepossible. towards Matisse. The painting is a clear parody of Matisse’s earlier <i>Odalisque with a Tambourine</i>.The composition of the figures is strikingly similar: a woman lounges in an armchair at thecenter of the painting, arm raised above her head, decorative wallpaper behind her. Bothpaintings feature vivid color contrasts, with green wallpaper, vivid reds, glaring yellows, andrich browns. But Picasso’s painting, finished in 1929, mocks the achievements of Matisse’s earlier work. The sensuous, rich mood of Matisse’s painting has been transformed in Picasso’swork into something harsh and grotesque. rich, warm, and curved, her head and arms forming a graceful arabesque. This image seems adirect attempt to master Matisse’s style and to suggest to the older artist new directions for hiswork. While there may well be an edge of competitiveness to the painting, a sense that Picassowas demonstrating his ability to do Matisse’s work, it remains in large part a helpful hint. of 1940, he proposes a revision of Picasso’s work. Again, a woman lies asleep on a table, herarm tucked beneath her head. Matisse accepts Picasso’s basic suggestions for his style: sinuouscurves, volumes, and shocking uses of color to express an effect. But Matisse also modifies theearlier work significantly. Color is no longer rigidly tied to form, as bits of fuchsia seep outsidethe thick black line marking the outline of the table and the patch of yellow on the woman’s blouse refuses to be contained by the drawn line. Matisse uses Picasso’s same palette of red,purple, white, black, and yellow to create this revision, editing out only the garish green, asif to chide Picasso for the choice. The brilliant interplay of colors in Matisse’s work is far moresophisticated and subtle than that offered by Picasso. “Thank you,” Matisse seems to be saying,“but you missed a few spots.”</p>

The author expresses the point at the end of the first paragraph by suggesting that the rivalry between Picasso and Matisse was more of a dialogue, or “exchange.” This would match choice (D), that “rivalries can be reciprocally nourishing.” Choice (A) is an incorrect comparison because the passage rejects the idea that such rivalries are mere competitions. Choice (B) distorts a detail by adding an opinion not stated in the passage. The author writes about the artists employing multiple styles, but never implies they are masters <i>because</i> they employ multiple styles. Choice (C) is a distortion based on a misreading of the “conversation” metaphor. Choice (E) is incorrect, as the word “generally” is a claim that the author does not make; the passage concerns one particular rivalry.</p>

            <p>Which of the following, if true, most seriously calls into question the exterminator’s claim that the absence of signs for three weeks means the mice have been eradicated by the poison?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)Because mice hide whenever they sense humans, it is very difficult to see or hear mice even when there is an active infestation.</p>
            <p>(B)It is more humane to use “live-catch” traps that allow homeowners to release the still-living mice outside.</p>
            <p>(C)In the spring, many mice that nest in houses begin foraging for food outside and do not return to the comfort of the house until the fall or winter.</p>
            <p>(D)There are several different kinds of poison that could be used, some of which are more effective than others.</p>
            <p>(E)It sometimes takes longer than three weeks for all of the mice to ingest and die from the poison.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>6. <b>(C).</b> The exterminator explains the effects of using poisoned food to combat a mouse infestation: mice will pick up the food and carry it to the nest, where all of the mice will eat the food and die as a result. The exterminator then claims that if X happens, then it will be certain that Y happened first. Specifically, he claims that if all signs of the mice disappear for three consecutive weeks after setting out poisoned food, then the mice all must have died as a result of that poisoned food. The correct answer will weaken this claim, for instance by showing that if X happens, it will not necessarily mean that Y happened; perhaps there is another reason why X happens.</p>
            <p>(A) This choice is very tempting, but the exterminator argues that “all signs” of the mice “disappear”; this choice mentions only the difficulty of seeing and hearing mice. These do not represent “all signs” of an infestation; mice may leave droppings, chew things up, and so forth. Further, the mice are not harder to see and hear only after poison has been used. They are always hard to see and hear, so this does not provide an alternative explanation as to why signs might diminish or disappear after poison has been used.</p>
            <p>(B) This choice may be true, but it does not address the exterminator’s claim that if all signs disappear, then the <i>poison</i> must have killed the mice.</p>
            <p><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> This choice offers an alternative explanation for the absence of signs of an infestation. If the mice have left the house, then any signs of infestation would also cease because the mice are no longer there. However, the signs will have ceased because the mice left voluntarily, not because they have been eradicated by the poison, as claimed by the exterminator.</p>
            <p>(D) It is likely true that different poisons have different levels of efficacy, but this argument does not distinguish between types of poison. The claim is simply that the poison must have killed the mice (as opposed to some other explanation for why the signs of mice would disappear).</p>
            <p>(E) The exterminator does not claim that the poison will work within three weeks (or within any time frame at all). He only claims that if the signs disappear over three consecutive weeks, then that means that the poison worked. It might be the case that the signs don’t disappear until weeks 3, 4, or 5, but the exterminator’s claim would still hold: because the signs have disappeared for three consecutive weeks, the poison worked.</p>

          <p><span>Exterminator:</span> Using poisoned food is the most effective tactic for combating a mouse infestation. The mouse will carry the food back to the nest, causing all of the mice to die, while a trap will kill only the one mouse that falls into it. If all signs of the mice disappear for three consecutive weeks after poisoned food is used, the homeowner can be sure that the poison was successful in eradicating the mice.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="B">
            <p>7. <b>(C).</b> The conclusion is that “if major industries increase their capital reserves, the employment rate will not decline in the future.” Why? Because major industry did not have capital reserves. The author assumes that having capital reserves is sufficient to prevent a decline in the employment rate. Weakening that assumption would effectively cast doubt on the author’s claim, and a choice that demonstrates that other factors are involved would do so.</p>
            <p>(A) Whether the drop in employment was foreseen does not relate to the core of the argument, which is that capital reserves will prevent another decline in the employment rate.</p>
            <p>(B) The fact that some major industries had appreciable capital reserves does not contradict the claim that an increase in these reserves would prevent a future drop in employment rates.</p>
            <p><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> The author neglects to take into account the fact that other factors, such as an increase in labor costs, could adversely affect the employment rate. For example, if the cost of labor becomes prohibitively expensive, even with increased reserves, the employment rate could decline.</p>
            <p>(D) Legislation mandating a certain level of reserves does not contradict the claim that increased reserves would prevent a drop in employment rates.</p>
            <p>(E) The fact that the drop in employment rate was more severe this year than last does not contradict the claim that an increase in reserves would prevent a drop in the employment rate.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="passage5" class="passage">
          <p>The recent decline in the employment rate was spurred by predictions of slow economic growth in the coming year. However, those predictions would not have affected the employment rate if major industries had not lacked capital reserves. So if major industries increase their capital reserves, the employment rate will not decline in the future.</p>
