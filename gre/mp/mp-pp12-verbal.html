            <p>67. <b>A deft, whet.</b> “Although” indicates that the first blank must be something positive or interesting to the students. Only “deft” (skillful) works. “Insipid” (uninteresting) and “effete” (weak or ineffectual) are not positive ways of describing a politician. Despite the fact that the historical figure was so accomplished, he also had old-fashioned views; as a result, the professor hasn’t been able to get the students interested in him. “Whet,” which means stimulate, is the only word that fits. “Tout” is a bit of a trap—the professor could “tout” the historical figure as an interesting thing to learn about, but she can’t “tout” someone’s interest. Similarly, “accrue” means accumulate over time, which doesn’t fit here; although interest (money earned on a loan or bank deposit) can be accumulated over time, people’s interest in a topic is not said to accumulate.</p>

A good word for the blank would mean something like sharp or biting or controversial. “Acerbic” (sharp, sarcastic, or candid in an almost bitter way) is the best choice. “Ample” (big or large) doesn’t explain why her wit is so controversial. “Anachronistic” means out of place in time, and “abstruse” means difficult to understand.

            <p>69. <b>Halcyon.</b> The opposition structure is complicated. “Contrary” followed by “anything but” functions as a double negative, so the blank will agree with the Western-held assumptions about mindfulness. Additionally, a semicolon followed by “while” indicates that the blank will agree with “calm the mind” and oppose “restlessness and doubt.” “Mystical,” then, does not match the meaning and might be considered a theme trap. “Beneficial” and “benign” both add a negative spin not justified by the the rest of the sentence. “Orthodox” also does not match the meaning.

            <p>70. <b>An anemic</b> While anemia is a medical condition, “anemic” as a metaphor means weak or lacking vitality; the job market is weak, so young people are choosing graduate school instead. “Myopia,” or nearsightedness, also makes a good metaphor, but describes people and their decisions. The job market hasn’t been “botched” (who botched it?), and it isn’t “booming” (the sentence says that there aren’t many jobs available). “Educated” is a trap answer; the young people are going to graduate school because the job market is bad, not because the job market is “educated.”</p>

Start with the second. His opponent is relatively new to politics so he doesn’t have as many campaign promises, or “obligations,” to “make good on.” It isn’t possible to make good on “dilemmas” or on “affiliations.” In contrast to the new politician, then, the “career politician” must must have had more obligations; in other words, he is “more beholden to corporate interests.” If he were “leery of” these interests, then the word “despite” couldn’t be used at the beginning of the sentence.

            <p>72. <b>Diffident, quietly.</b> The initial “Far too” indicates that the first blank will oppose “limelight” (an old theatrical expression meaning to be in the spotlight) and agree with “unassuming” (shy). “Diffident” (shy or reserved) is a good match and is also a clue for the second blank, which must match the first one; “quietly” is the best choice. Neither “implicitly” nor “skeptically” matches the meaning of shy or reserved. “Ideologically” is a theme trap that ignores the objective clues. “Apathetic” (unenergetic, indifferent) is also a spin trap.</p>

            <p>67. <b>Lax, slack.</b> The answers must parallel “slouching posture and cavalier attitude.” Note that cavalier is used here to mean offhand or disdainful. Thus, “aristocratic” is a bit of a trap answer, as are “murderous” and “barbarous,” which don’t match the clues—while this person’s actions caused horrific loss of life, it doesn’t sound as though that was his intention. “Petty” (of secondary or little importance) also doesn’t fit here.

            <p>68. <b>Harmony, euphony.</b> If the composer’s latest work is a “major departure from” the “dissonance represented by her early compositions,” then the blank should be a word that means harmony or pleasant sound. In addition to the word “harmony” itself, “euphony” means pleasant sound, so these would both stand in contrast to “dissonance.” “Harshness” and “stridency,” on the other hand, are synonyms for “dissonance” and would therefore not be a departure at all. Neither “disparity” nor “creativity” contrasts with “dissonance,” nor does either choice have a pair among the other answers.</p>

Therefore, they continued to “dally” or “tarry.” The incorrect pair “lurk” and “skulk” has a negative, furtive connotation—the words are related to hanging around for some bad reason.

In other words, the player was given many nicknames; “appelations” and “sobriquets” both fit. Although “kudos” and “accolades,” which both mean praise, form a tempting theme trap because the sentence talks about the player’s admirers, neither captures the idea of a nickname. A “misnomer” is something of a nickname, but a false one, so it doesn’t fit either. “Similes” is tricky because is sounds like “similar,” but it is a figure of speech used to describe something by comparing it to something else, not a nickname.</p>

The blank, then, must be filled by words that mean the opposite of full of life. “Desolate,” which means bleakly empty, and “inhospitable,” which when describing an environment means hard to live in, both fit: casual observers don’t see much life in deserts. Although “arid” and “dessicated” both mean dried up and seem like good descriptions of a desert, they are not correct because they are not opposites of “teeming.” “Verdant” and “lush” are a reversal trap, as both are used to describe an environment that is full of greenery and plant life.</p>

          <p>Simone de Beauvoir’s feminism was heavily informed by existentialist ethics. Withinthis frame of thought, good and evil are expressed in human beings’ transcendence and“immanence,” respectively. Human existence can only be justified via continually expandinginto the future by engaging in freely chosen projects—i.e., transcendence. Transcendence is thus a general goal for human beings, while its opposite—immanence—is considered adegradation of existence, from “liberty into constraint.” Freely chosen, immanence is a moralfault, but when inflicted, it is described as “oppression.” In a social environment in whichwomen are prevented from choosing and engaging in serious projects because of their statusas women, their ability to transcend is systemically thwarted, so transcendence becomes a specifically feminist goal. De Beauvoir explains that women are viewed as intrinsically passiveand immanent, in opposition to men who are meant to be active and transcendent. to each other. As de Beauvoir notes, the nature of this relationship, overlapping the assumptionthat men are the active transcendent half of humanity, leaves women in a position of forcedimmanence.</p>

            <p>findings of Galileo are more important than those of Aristotle. Further, the author only discusses one finding of each philosopher/scientist, so this answer is out of scope.</p>

          <p>What differentiates science and non-science? According to the modern definition ofscience, the Ancient Greeks were not scientists but rather philosophers. Their investigationswere performed in an unscientific manner, as is illustrated by Aristotle and his conclusionsabout the properties of water. Before studying water, Aristotle discovered that matter existed in three main categories: solid, liquid, and gas. He concluded that a solid was the least expandedof the three and verified this by seeing that a solid always sank in a liquid of the same type.However, when Aristotle encountered water, he saw that it had properties that contradictedhis previous categorization. In order to reconcile this disparity, he postulated that water was anexception and that the shape of solid water caused it to stay afloat. This, of course, is incorrect. To the contrary, the studies of Galileo Galilei followed a certain self-made doctrinefor gathering data and performing scientific experiments. Galileo’s method forced one tofirst form a hypothesis, then design an experiment to confirm or deny this hypothesis, andthen accept or discard the hypothesis based on one’s findings. Using this method, Galileodisproved many commonly held misconceptions about the rules of physics. In one of his more famous experiments, Galileo hypothesized that the Earth’s gravitational field resulted in thesame acceleration of all objects, regardless of mass. To prove this, he dropped two iron ballsof different masses from an elevated place and showed that gravity pulled on both massesevenly. This experiment disproved the commonly held belief (at the time) that an object withgreater mass would fall to the ground more quickly.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>81. <b>(D).</b> As the second paragraph states, Galileo’s method “forced one to first form a hypothesis, then design an experiment to confirm or deny this hypothesis, and then accept or discard the hypothesis based on one’s findings.” Aristotle’s hypothesis was that solids were the least expanded form of matter, and the experiment he designed to prove this was to show that solids sank within liquids of the same type. As this did not hold true for water, under the Galilean method Aristotle would be forced to discard his hypothesis based on the results of his experiment. Thus, choice (D) is correct. Regarding (A), the passage does not contain any information about the shape of solid water or of other solid forms of matter, only about Aristotle’s conjectures on the shape of solid water. Regarding (B), the passage claims the opposite of this fact: an object with larger mass will not fall to the ground more quickly than an object with lesser mass. As for (C), the passage states that the ancient Greeks were more philosophers than scientists, but never prohibits one from being both. As for (E), the passage states that Galileo used his scientific method to disprove many commonly held misconceptions about the rules of physics, but never states that one cannot do this in the absence of his method.</p>

          <p>Lousia May Alcott’s <i>Little Women</i> opens to a common scenario—the women knittingat home and waiting for news from the man of the family, who is at the war front. The familydynamics of <i>Little Women</i>, as a microcosm of the larger society, are marked by explicitlyarticulated male dominance. The division of labor has it so that women are confined to the domestic sphere while men step into the public sphere and engage in activities there,returning to the domestic sphere at night to be cared for by their spouse or female children.Alcott describes the character of Meg, a young wife, as “often … lonely,” with her husband“absent till night, and nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.” though she is a woman. Ultimately, however, “taking her part in the world’s work” meant nomore than talking to her husband about politics whilst remaining at home, allowing him tocontinue to be the mediator between Meg’s individuality and the world at large. Chapter 38of the novel wraps up the issue by concluding that “a woman’s happiest kingdom is home, herhighest honor the art of ruling it [as a] wise wife and mother,” such position being “the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid, safe from the restless fret andfever of the world.” Some have read Alcott’s romantic glorification of women’s confinement assarcastic, but either way, her loving readers must have agreed with the statement, for the novelhas never been out of print.</p>

Therefore, the correct answer cannot describe either boldface portion as the author’s final conclusion. The first section details an earlier, erroneous belief. Any answer choice that suggests that the author agrees with this first statement is incorrect. The second boldface statement shows that the earlier theory—that lactic acid causes soreness—was incorrect, and thus also provides evidence in support of the author’s conclusion. So, the correct answer must describe the second boldface portion as supporting the conclusion.</p>
            <p>(A) This choice misrepresents the first bolded portion by claiming that the author accepts it as true. The author presents it as an incorrect, outdated belief. The second portion is also incorrect because it indicates that the second bolded portion supports the first one.</p>

The acid, they claimed, is the waste produced by metabolic activity in the muscle and reaches “threshold” levels, causing soreness, when the muscle has depleted its oxygen supply. <b>Researchers have recently discovered, however, that lactic acid is actually the fuel that powers muscular activity.</b> Therefore, the cause of muscle soreness remains unknown.</p>

            <p>(A) It is not necessary to the conclusion that a third party affirmed the company’s determination because the conclusion accepts that the oil deposit was indeed smaller than indicated by the prospector and focuses on the cause of the discrepancy as opposed to the discrepancy itself.</p>
