            <p>103. <b>Robust.</b> The bacteria that survive antibiotics would presumably be those hardest to kill. You might also want a word that means something like drug-resistant. The only word that means anything like hard-to-kill is “robust.” “Widespread,” “immature,” and “benign” (not harmful) do not indicate that the bacteria are inherently harder to kill. Although “notorious” (well known for something bad) is tempting, a “notorious” bacteria is not necessarily hard to kill; it could just be particularly infectious or toxic.</p>

            <p>104. <b>Prodigies.</b> These very intelligent children actually do “fulfill their early promise,” so the blank should indicate that they really are talented in some way. Such children are “prodigies.” Although “teenagers” is tempting because children become teenagers, the sentence says that the children “go on to fulfill their early promise,” implying that they lead extraordinary lives, and teenager-hood is only a short part of someone’s life. The other answers, “cranks,” theorizers,” and “pragmatists” (practical people), are not supported by the sentence.</p>

            <p>105. <b>Heuristic, represent.</b> The first word is defined in the sentence as a device useful for “inciting and guiding discovery.” That’s one of the meanings of “heuristic,” which is the correct answer. A “literary device” is a common expression and so sounds good, but the meaning is wrong because a “literary device” is a technique used in writing to produce a specific effect. An “allegorical” (symbolic or metaphorical) device is a specific type of “literary device” and so doesn’t work either. If you are not meant to take the “model of the psyche” as a guide to the physical structure of the brain, then you want a word that means something like show or depict for the second blank. “Represent” is the closest choice. The word “dictate” is incorrect because a model of the brain doesn’t determine the physical form of the brain. “Ameliorate” (make a bad thing better) also does not fit the desired meaning.</p>

            <p>106. <b>Technical, diffident.</b> Since the “medium … lacked a voice,” the technology of the day prevented Lloyd from speaking on film, so the first word should be something like technological. “Technical” will do. Neither “artistic” nor “commercial” describes the limits of films that lacked a voice. The second blank requires an adjective that would explain why a character would fail to speak, perhaps something like mute. “Diffident” means something like self-effacing or very shy and very shy people are often somewhat reluctant to speak; this is the best choice. “Reluctant” is a trap answer—it does not mean reluctant to speak (the similar-sounding reticent does, and the two words are often confused). “Avant-garde” (developing new or experimental artistic concepts) does not fit the desired meaning.</p>

Neither “banality” (boring, ordinary) nor “deviation” (different from the norm) fits the desired meaning. The sentence also indicates that there is “a lack of local news coverage,” so local “events are no longer covered by smaller media.” The best match for local is “regional.” “Domestic” is a good trap, but when applied to locations, this word typically refers to an entire country (domestic vs. international). “Elaborate” does not mean local. Finally, the smaller media groups can’t afford to hire, or “staff,” enough employees. “Imply” is a trap because it sounds very close to employ. “Broadcast” seems to go along with media, but does not fit the desired meaning of this blank.</p>

It “inevitably” or “unavoidably” joined the “culture of the old.” The sentence does not provide information to believe that this happens “accidentally” nor its opposite, “deliberately.” Similarly for “resolutely” and “painfully,” the sentence does not provide a clue to suggest that this is how it became “a part of the culture of the old.”</p>

The answer should be close to sorrow, perhaps something like regret. “Rue” and “remorse” are the nearest synonyms and are therefore the correct answer pair. “Disdain” and “contempt” are also synonyms, but anger and sorrow do not pair as well as regret and sorrow. “Pity” might work if it had a pair in the answer choices, while “affinity” has no pair and also doesn’t have the same negative tone that the other answer choices have.</p>

You might anticipate an answer like huge. “Exhaustive,” which means including everything, and “sweeping,” which means extensive, both fit. If a collection is “piecemeal,” it would have been acquired piece by piece over time. Likely as that might be, there’s no clue in the sentence that would suggest this. “Voluble” means talkative and does not fit, nor does “evergreen,” which means fresh or popular.

The word “imperious,” meaning arrogant and domineering, is close, but doesn’t have the same strength as the correct answers do. “Partisan” and “biased” do form a pair, but do not contrast with “conciliatory.” Finally, an attack that is “dissembling” would be sneaky or bluffing, but the sentence does not suggest that the attack was meant to be sneaky.</p>

          <p>Quantum mechanics is a relatively new field of physics that was developed in the early1900s. Although we classically think of a particle as a fixed object, quantum mechanicsdescribes particles as waves using properties such as position and energy. The quantummechanical wave describes the probability that the particle’s properties take on certain values. Take, for example, the analogy of rolling a six-sided die. For each roll there is a one-in-sixchance that any single number will result. After rolling, however, only one single number willbe observed. If the die is rolled enough times, one can deduce that the die has six sides andthat each side is equally likely. However, one can never be completely sure, because rolling diceis probabilistic in nature. Quantum mechanics states that the same is true of the position (and other properties) of a particle. A particle trapped in a closed box has some finite probability ofbeing at any location within the box. Open the box once and you’ll find the particle at only onelocation. Open the box enough times and you’ll see all the particle locations and the frequencyat which they are achieved. From this, one can deduce the original properties of the quantummechanical wave, just as one could deduce the properties of the die. The counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, that the attributes of a particlecannot be known in advance of measurement, initially provoked many strong philosophicaldebates and interpretations regarding the field. In fact, Einstein was deeply troubled by theidea of nature being probabilistic and commented famously that, “God does not play dice withthe universe.” Over the last 70 years, however, irrefutable evidence has abounded that verifies the truth of the theory of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>122. <b>1st and 3rd only.</b> According to the second paragraph, not knowing that they are seeing a theater piece allows viewers to “avoid the etiquette of theatergoing” and “engage with the action and concepts of an unfolding drama as if these actions and concepts were real.” This is a good match with the first statement. The third paragraph refers to “scripted characters” in invisible theater, so it cannot be inferred that “invisible theater is best described as improvised.” Another reference to “dialogue … set up by invisible theater performers” weighs against invisible theater being improvisational. The third paragraph begins, “Boal has documented various successful instances of invisible theater in which non-performers … take unplanned public-minded action in response to the dialogue and events set up by invisible theater performers.” The last sentence of the passage also states that “the goal of guerilla theater is to get people talking publicly.” Thus, it can be inferred that “actions taken by the audience once the performance is over” can be one measure of success of a theater piece.</p>

          <p>Invisible theater and guerrilla theater are two forms of street theater with similar originsbut very different approaches. Both forms take place exclusively in public places, but invisibletheater conceals its performative nature whereas guerrilla theater flaunts it. While invisibletheater creates a performance space unbeknownst to its audience, guerrilla theater actively seeks the attention of an audience by explicitly imposing a performance space onto a publicplace. distinct, invisible theater returns somewhat to the model set up by traditional theater. However,there are a few key differences. The performance space is created in public places withoutthe awareness of non-performers. For non-performers, being beyond the performative spaceallows them to avoid the etiquette of theatergoing and removes that “lens” that unavoidablyemerges when we feel we are viewing art or performance. If people do not suspect that they are viewing art, however, they are free to engage with the action and concepts of an unfoldingdrama as if these actions and concepts were real. performers. Because onlookers think they are witnessing real life events, because theperformers are bold in their statements, because the scripted characters are very vocalabout what they are doing and experiencing, invisible theater is able to instigate politicalconversation within an everyday context; it successfully creates public forums out of thin air. imposition of “traditional” (if we can call anything about guerrilla theater “traditional”) theater.One example includes two professors of Galway’s University College who dressed in their robesand went out to the street, questioning pedestrians and awarding diplomas to the ones leastable to provide good answers, as a way to protest their university’s decision to grant RonaldReagan an honorary doctorate in law. A large part of the goal of guerrilla theater is to get publicized, its message echoed overand over in our ever-expanding network of technology-interface mass media. Guerrilla theaterknows it may antagonize its direct audience—it often hopes to, because conflict is more likelyto be broadcast, and the goal of guerrilla theater is to get people talking publicly.</p>

Choice (B) is incorrect because the passage doesn’t say which form is more effective. Choice (C) is too broad and the evolution is not the focus. Choice (D) is incorrect because the first paragraph states clearly that “invisible theater conceals its performative nature whereas guerrilla theater flaunts it.” Choice (E) is too broad as the passage does not cover all artistic life in public places.</p>

            <p>(A)At least some foreign companies that conduct stem cell research work under fewer restrictions than some United States companies do.</p>

            <p>(C)In all parts of the world, stem cell research is dependent on the financial backing of local government.</p>
            <p>(D)In the near future, U.S. companies will no longer be at the forefront of stem cell research.</p>
            <p>(E)If restrictions on stem cell research are lifted, many of the scientists previously based in the United States will break their contracts to return to U.S. companies.</p>

            <p>44. <b>(A).</b> In this argument, a cause and effect relationship is presented between scientists based in the U.S. who sign long-term contracts with foreign companies and the U.S. government’s restrictions on stem cell research. This cause and effect relationship is the key to the correct answer.</p>
            <p><b>(A) CORRECT.</b> If scientists based in the United States signed the contracts because of restrictions in that country, it must follow that their new employers were under fewer restrictions. Therefore, at least some foreign companies must work under fewer restrictions than some U.S. companies do.</p>
            <p>(B) While it is possible that once the restrictions are lifted, U.S. companies will want to hire more scientists and will seek them overseas, there are too many unknowns between the given premises and this conclusion. It is doubtful that an increase in the number of immigrating stem cell research scientists would have a “significant” impact on the number of “foreign professionals” overall.</p>
            <p>(C) This passage is about government restrictions; no information is given about “financial backing.” Beware of extreme statements such as “in all parts of the world.”</p>
            <p>(D) No information is given concerning the current or future position of the United States in terms of stem cell research. Though restrictions and scientists switching companies are two issues related to a company’s prosperity, there is no information about how these issues directly affect the position of the United States.</p>

          <p> Government restrictions have severely limited the amount of stem cell research companies in the United States can conduct. Because of these restrictions, many scientists previously based in the United States and specializing in the field of stem cell research have signed long-term contracts to work for foreign companies. Recently, Congress has proposed lifting all restrictions on stem cell research.</p>

            <p>(B)Studies have shown that Congress traditionally determines NASA’s budget based on its perception of public interest in NASA’s projects.</p>

            <p>45. <b>(D).</b> In the argument, the critics mistake correlation for causation.

          <p> If life exists elsewhere in the solar system, scientists suspect it would most likely be on Europa, an ice covered moon orbiting Jupiter. However, NASA recently scrapped an unmanned science mission to Europa and reassigned most of the employees involved in the project to another project that concerns landing an astronaut on Mars. Polls show that Americans are far more fascinated by space travel than they are by discovering life elsewhere in the universe. Critics argue that NASA’s decision-making process places a greater emphasis on public interest than it does on the importance of scientific research.</p>
