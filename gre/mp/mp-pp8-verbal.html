            <p>43. <b>Artifices.</b> The clues “bifurcated” and “but” signal a contrast: commercial portrait painters are similar to other painters in some ways, but the blank refers to how they are in some ways different than those other painters (they try to make the subject look more attractive in the painting). The correct answer, “artifices,” means a trickery or deception and fits perfectly with the clue. Trap answers “palettes” and “aesthetics” are related to painting, but don’t match the meaning of the blank. “Artifacts” is a trap word that looks similar to “artifices” but means a historic relic. “Sentiments” is an attitude, but the sentence provides no information about the painter’s attitude or how that would make the subject of the piece more attractive.</p>

            <p>44. <b>Pedantry.</b> The correct answer should parallel “dogmatic” and match the negative spin of “enervates rather than inspires.” “Wisdom,” “pulchritude” (beauty), and “wit” are all positive terms that don’t match with the sentence structure. Only “pedantry” (being arrogant in relation to learning) and “parsimony” (stinginess) are negative, and only “pedantry” fits the idea of an uninspiring professor.</p>

            <p>45. <b>Minutiae.</b> The correct answer must reflect the clue “petty” and oppose the idea of “lofty goals.” Lincoln felt that McClellan paid so much attention to trivial details, or “minutiae,” that he ignored the big picture. The trap answer “irrelevancies” is incorrect because the “logistical details” are not irrelevant; they are merely minor, or not worthy of so much attention. “Tactics” and “strategy” don’t convey the idea of minor details. And nothing in the sentence suggests that attention was being placed on minor offenses or “peccadilloes.”</p>

            <p>47. <b>Conventionality, laudatory.</b> The word “surprisingly” before blank (ii) indicates that the blanks will oppose each other in tone; since the reviewers gave “unabashed approbation,” the second blank should be a positive word, such as receptive. “Laudatory” is a synonym for “approbation” and is therefore the correct answer. “Tepid,” meaning lukewarm, and “deprecating,” meaning to belittle or express disapproval, are not good matches. Given the oppositional structure, blank (i) should be negative. “Ingenuity” is too positive. “Tortuousness,” meaning twisting or crooked, and “conventionality” both have negative connotations. The reviewers “usually pounce on the slightest orthodoxy,” or widely accepted theory, so the best match is “conventionality.”</p>

            <p>48. <b>Dissipation, profligate.</b> “Ironically” is a good clue here—the commentator condemned a quality that he himself actually possessed! Both words should be negative, similar in meaning, and match the idea of bankruptcy. “Dissipation” and “profligate” are both related to wastefulness or irresponsible living. “Indolence” means laziness, “probity” means integrity, “antediluvian” means outdated, and “ascetic” means austere. Notice that while some of the other words do have a negative spin, none of the incorrect choices are similar in meaning or match the idea of bankruptcy.</p>

Watch out for trap answers “surplus,” which means an excess and would not be appropriate to describe bird species, and “pantheon,” which means all of the gods in a particular religion and also would not be appropriate to describe a number of bird species. “Contraband,” meaning illegal goods, and “aurora,” used to describe the dawn or other lights in the sky, are great GRE words, but not good fits for the blank.</p>

            <p>44. <b>Witticisms, quips.</b> The first part of sentence says that, even though Longworth was known for “bon mots,” which literally means “good words” in French and is generally used to describe wisecracks or one-liners, she was actually a “very kind” person. Given that her “_________ did not reflect any vindictiveness,” or meanness, the blank must be another word for “bon mots,” such as “witticisms” or “quips.” Although “vituperations,” meaning verbally abusive language, and “rants” also form a pair, they are much more negative than “bon mots” and therefore not a match. “Taciturnity” describes the state of being taciturn, or untalkative, and so has the wrong meaning. “Zeal” which means fervor or enthusiasm, doesn’t have the correct meaning either, and also isn’t used quite correctly in this expression. Although “zeal” can be passed from person to person, it isn’t explicitly circulated, the way that one-liners are.</p>

While “alluring” and “attractive” are a pair of words with similar meanings, there is nothing in the sentence that suggests she is pleasing to the eye. Of the remaining words, “unprecedented” does not work, since there is no clue that she is the first opportunist, and “unqualified” fails as well, since there is no clue that she is not qualified as an opportunist.

The debate is more or less frozen. Both “a confrontation” and “an engagement” imply some kind of clash, but the sentence implies that any kind of serious clashing is now over (no one had anything new to offer). “An impasse” and “a stalemate” reflect the static nature of the conflict. “A pause” and “a timeout” are not correct because there is no indication that the debate will continue.</p>

            <p>48. <b>Duplicitous, cloaked</b> The sentence begins by suggesting that social media has fast and far-reaching effects, so celebrities wanting to “conceal their foibles” would need to do something that would resemble what a spy ring would do: be unobserved or deceitful. The correct answers are “duplicitous” and “cloaked,” both of which mean deceitful or concealed. While a spy ring might act in a way that is “draconian” (excessively harsh) or “arduous” (difficult or tiring), these words don’t fit with the sentence, nor do they have matching words among the answer choices.

The second statement is wrong because even though a film that focused only on African American issues could be just as limited as one that failed to focus on such issues, there is a significant difference: one would be reinforcing the dominant culture, while the other would be presenting an alternative culture. Baldwin would thus be unlikely to find them equally problematic.

In “Congo Square,” Baldwinopens his essay with an important idea: “A child is far too self-centered to relate to any dilemmawhich does not, somehow, relate to him.” Watching the films of the dominant culture, Baldwinattempted to relate the information to his own life, connecting with it however he could.Rather than blindly accept the storylines in the movies, when Baldwin saw a staircase in <i>A Tale</i><i>of Two Cities</i>, he thought, “I knew about staircases.”</p>

Choice (D) is correct because even though the quote doesn’t explicitly mention black children, the point is that children in general can’t relate to a dilemma that doesn’t relate to them. Because the passage indicates that Hollywood films of the era “dealt with white issues and employed white actors,” these films would not have related to black children, who would have thus been alienated from mainstream culture.

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>55. <b>(C).</b> Choice (A) is wrong because many of its characteristics have in fact been worked out. Choice (B) is wrong because the passage is not primarily about artistic interpretation. Choice (C) is correct because “idiosyncratic” is a synonym for unique, and the frieze is said to be unique in two ways. Choice (D) is incorrect because only one paragraph discusses the existence of mortals in the frieze and because this title is much too broad. Choice (E) is a trap: all sides of the frieze are continuous, not the individual characters.</p>

            <p>56. <b>(D).</b> Choice (A) is incorrect because the first sentence indicates that the Parthenon was constructed in the “High Classical Period.” Choice (B) is incorrect because the same sentence says that the Parthenon was “regarded as a great architectural and artistic product.” Choice (C) is incorrect because the frieze is said to have come from the “temple-chamber” of the Parthenon. Choice (D) is correct because the passage says only that it is “difficult to study” the frieze because not all of it survives “today” and the surviving parts are in different locations. This doesn’t necessarily mean that today’s scholars don’t know what the missing portions looked like at the time of construction (perhaps drawings of the Parthenon survive, for example). Choice (E) is incorrect because the frieze is described as “unique” and defined as a “structural element” of the Parthenon.</p>

            <p>Which of the following, if true, would cast the most doubt on the validity of the head of engineering’s decision?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)New competitors have entered the market every six months for the past two years, resulting in price wars that have progressively driven down revenues across the market.</p>
            <p>(B)Although the earthquake occurred two years ago, the region’s mines have still not recovered to pre-earthquake production capacity.</p>
            <p>(C)There are several other regions in the world where the raw material is mined, but those regions do not produce as much of the raw material as the current source region.</p>
            <p>(D)The company could use a completely different raw material to make its product.</p>
            <p>(E)Recent advances in mining technology will make mining the raw material much more efficient and cost-effective in the future.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>18. <b>(A).</b> The argument rests on the assumption that there is a connection between the one-time raw material price increase and the two-year steady decline in profit margins. Alternatively, something else could have caused either a steady two-year decline in revenues or a steady two-year increase in costs; if so, this event is more likely to be the cause of a steady decline in profit margins over the same two-year period. As a result, this would weaken the engineer’s conclusion that finding a new source for the raw material will improve profit margins.</p>
            <p><b>(A) CORRECT.</b> New competitors have caused a steady two-year decline in revenues. This weakens the engineer’s assumption that the one-time doubling of costs for the raw material is the cause of the steady two-year decline in profit margins.</p>
            <p>(B) The fact that the region’s mines are producing less than they did before the earthquake does not indicate anything about the cost of the raw material; to weaken the engineer’s conclusion, it would be necessary to show that cost is not reduced.</p>
            <p>(C) The amount of raw material produced by other regions does not indicate anything about the cost of the raw material; to weaken the engineer’s conclusion, it would be necessary to show that cost is not reduced.</p>
            <p>(D) The use of a different raw material does not indicate anything about the cost of that raw material; to weaken the engineer’s conclusion, it would be necessary to show that cost is not reduced.</p>
            <p>(E) Although mining the raw material may become more cost-effective for the mine (that is, cheaper), this does not indicate what will happen to the price the mine charges for the material when selling to the company producing the product in question. To weaken the engineer’s conclusion, it would be necessary to show that cost is not reduced.</p>

          <p> Two years ago, the cost of the raw material used in a particular product doubled after an earthquake disrupted production in the region where the material is mined. Since that time, the company that makes the product has seen its profit margins decline steadily. Aiming to improve profit margins, the company’s head of engineering has decided that he must find a new source for the raw material.</p>

            <p>Which of the following statements, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument above?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)Graduates of private schools typically score higher on standardized tests and other tests of academic achievement.</p>
            <p>(B)While private schools are typically very expensive, attendance of public school is free for the residents of the county.</p>
            <p>(C)In comparison with graduates of private schools, a substantially greater proportion of public school graduates receive need-based financial aid for their college education.</p>
            <p>(D)In comparison with private schools, public schools provide more opportunities for student involvement in sports and other athletic activities, which almost always increase the likelihood of students’ acceptance to colleges.</p>
            <p>(E)Since most public schools are located in rural areas of the county populated primarily by farmers, nearly 30% of students from public high schools choose to pursue farming occupations rather than apply to colleges.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>19. <b>(E).</b> The argument concludes that children in this county are more likely to attend college if they attend private high schools instead of public high schools. The basis for this claim is that a higher percentage of graduates of private schools pursue a college education. It is assumed that public schools are inferior to private schools as a training ground for college. Any statement that provides an alternative explanation for the fact that public school graduates attend college at lower rates than private school graduates would weaken the argument.</p>
            <p>(A) While higher test scores might increase students’ chances of admission to college, this fact is unrelated to whether students will actually attend college. Even if one could prove that earning higher test scores makes a student more likely to attend college, this statement would not weaken the argument, but rather strengthen it.</p>
            <p>(B) Since the conclusion centers on the likelihood of attending college, economic and financial considerations for high school are outside the scope of the argument.</p>
            <p>(C) Since the amount of need-based aid is not directly related to whether a student will attend college, this statement is outside the scope of the argument.</p>
            <p>(D) While better athletic opportunities could increase students’ chances of admission to college, they are unrelated to whether students will actually attend college. Also, even though the advantages of public school mentioned in this statement were taken into account by the study, the proportion of graduates of public schools attending colleges remains substantially lower than the proportion of graduates of private schools.</p>
            <p><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> This answer choice demonstrates that the difference in the percentage of graduates attending colleges is not because of any advantage provided by private schools but because a subset of the graduates of public high schools simply choose to pursue a different career path. In other words, 30% of the graduates of public schools voluntarily choose not to pursue a college education. Yet 65% out of the remaining 70% of graduates end up in college. This statement indicates extremely high college matriculation rates for students who want to attend college after graduation from public high schools.</p>

        <div id="passage4" class="passage">
          <p> According to a recent research study, more than 90% of graduates of the private high schools in a certain county continue their education in college. By contrast, only 65% of graduates of the public high schools subsequently pursue college education. Therefore, if parents in the county wish to increase the likelihood that their children will attend college, they should send them to private rather than public schools.</p>

          <div class="question">
            <p>The above statements, if true, indicate that Airline A has made which of the following conclusions?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)The addition of standing room only “seats” will generate more revenue than the cost of ensuring that these seats meet safety standards.</p>
            <p>(B)The Federal Aviation Administration will approve Airline A’s specific proposal.</p>
            <p>(C)The revenue generated by the addition of standing room only “seats” is greater than the current cost of jet fuel.</p>
            <p>(D)There are no safer ways in which Airline A can increase revenues.</p>
            <p>(E)Passenger safety is less important than increasing revenue.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>20. <b>(A).</b> Only two pieces of information are given about Airline A’s standing room “seats” proposal. First, it is geared toward increasing revenue to counteract declining profits. Second, since the proposal relates to passenger safety, it must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. Airline A must have concluded that the cost of implementation of its proposal is less than the revenue that the new seats will generate.</p>
            <p><b>(A) CORRECT.</b> Since Airline A knows that its proposal would have to comply with safety standards, it must have concluded that the cost of compliance is worth it. In other words, the only way for Airline A to achieve its goal of increasing profit is to implement ideas that will generate more revenue than they cost. Airline A must therefore have concluded that the standing room only “seats” meet this criteria.</p>
            <p>(B) The statements in the passage imply nothing about whether Airline A believes that the Federal Aviation Administration will approve the proposal. Although Airline A must believe that the proposal has a chance of approval (otherwise it’s unlikely to have proposed it), the airline might have proposed its specific plan knowing that it might not be approved, or that it might have to be changed in certain ways.</p>
            <p>(C) Airline A’s goal is simply to “counteract declining profits” caused by the high cost of jet fuel. This does not mean, however, that the proposal must fully mitigate the cost of jet fuel. As long as the proposal increases revenue without an equal or greater increase in cost, it will in some way counteract declining profits.</p>
            <p>(D) The passage does not mention any other ways that Airline A has considered increasing revenues. Therefore, it is impossible to relate Airline A’s perception of its standing room “seats” proposal to any other proposals.</p>
            <p>(E) The statements in the passage do not address Airline A’s view regarding the safety of the standing room only “seats.” It is very possible that Airline A views its proposal as safe and sees no conflict between passenger safety and increasing revenue, much less that it has made any determination about the relative importance of these two issues.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="passage5" class="passage">
          <p> Due to high jet fuel costs, airline carriers are looking for new ways to increase revenues and thereby counteract declining profits. Airline A has proposed increasing the number of passengers that can fit on its airplanes by creating several standing room only “seats” in which passengers would be propped against a padded backboard and held in place with a harness. This proposal, since it relates to passenger safety, cannot be implemented without prior approval by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
