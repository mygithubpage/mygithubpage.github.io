            <p>121. <b>Buttress.</b> “Buttress,” as a noun or a verb, relates to support and is therefore justified by the clue “needed additional support.” Note that you certainly do not need to memorize architectural terms for the GRE, but you should definitely know the metaphorical meaning of buttress (to support). A “partition” is tempting, but the purpose of such a feature is to divide or separate two things, not necessarily to support something. An “albatross” is a bird but is also used metaphorically to mean an ongoing problem. While “hallmark” and “trademark” can be synonyms, they don’t mean to support.</p>

For the second blank, in order for the theory to be supported, or “resilient,” the results from independent labs should agree with each other, or be “consistent with” each other. The results don’t have to be “founded on” or “antithetical to” (opposed to) each other in order for the theory to be supported.</p>

The explanation in general may be “mysterious” or “obscure,” but the topic is not “mysterious” or “obscure” “to our daily lives.” Regarding the second blank, the expression “at once fascinating and _________” indicates at least a loose contrast, so you need something that could contrast with “fascinating.” The clue “so ignorant” is a good indication that what you want is “deeply humbling.” Don’t fall for the trap answer “fully impenetrable.” While the topic of sleep is presented as somewhat impenetrable (that is, hard to understand), the blank is not describing sleep, but rather human ignorance about it. “Totally blatant,” which means obvious or not at all hidden, doesn’t describe human ignorance about sleep either.</p>

The clue “beyond measure” indicates that his musical star must have grown, so “waxed” is the only possibility for the first blank; “abated” and “dwindled” both mean to get smaller. Mozart’s income must have either gone down or remained low; “barely stirred” is the correct answer for the second blank. It could not be the case that his income “grew exponentially” or “remained exorbitant,” or there would be no discrepancy.</p>

            <p>125. <b>Assent.</b> While the structure might seem tricky, the blank must oppose “refusing for a decade” since the patriarch finally “surrendered.” “Assent” is the best choice because it means agreement. “Ascent” (climb up), “dissent (disagreement), and “descent” (climb down) do not fit the text and are essentially phonetic tricks. “Assertion” does not fit because he cannot “give his assertion.” Rather, he would “assert” something.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="AEI">
            <p>126. <b>Peril, simulacrum, terrifies.</b> “Even” suggests that the first blank describes the sort of thing you might otherwise expect a thrill seeker to find attractive. These patrons do not want “danger,” so you could just reuse that word for the first blank. “Peril” is the best choice. Although “titillation” does describe a sort of thrill, it is not negative, nor does it suggest danger. “Lavishness” suggests luxury, not danger, and so does not fit either. The third word is probably easier to anticipate than the second, so skip ahead. “In fact” suggests that you want a word that means seems to be unsafe, and the description of the “thrill-seeking visitors” suggests that you want something, well, thrilling. “Terrifies” is the closest choice. “Satisfies” yields a perfectly fine sentence, but it does not contrast with “perfectly safe.” “Mollifies,” which means to sooth or pacify, is the opposite of what the thrill seekers want. The second blank, then, requires something like imitation, and “simulacrum” is the closest synonym among the answers. Using a “complement” here would imply something that partners with danger, which doesn’t match the meaning of imitation of danger. Similarly, an “abettor” of danger would be an aid or a helper, which doesn’t fit the intended meaning either.</p>

            <p>121. <b>Ephemeral, fleeting.</b> Something “lasting a millionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second” is very short-lived. “Ephemeral” and “fleeting” have just this meaning.

            <p>122. <b>Collaborative, synergetic.</b> The word “While” indicates that the “later contributions” were achieved in a manner opposite to “single-handedly.” Both “collaborative” and “synergetic” mean working together or in a group. Note that trap answers “solitary” and “unilateral” are the opposite of the required meaning, and “collusive” has the wrong spin—to collude is to cooperate for illegal or fraudulent purposes.

            <p>123. <b>A coup, an achievement.</b> The sentence suggests that despite the unimpressive media coverage of the event, the organizers were still pleased. The second part of the sentence states one specific positive aspect of the event: a “mass of everyday people” attended. Therefore, the best pair of words here would be “coup” and “achievement,” both of which can mean a successful move, and both of which match the positive feelings that the organizers felt. A “miracle” (a highly improbable event that can’t be explained by science) is too strong. Of the remaining options, “blemish” and “debacle” form a pair, but they contradict the intended meaning of the sentence. Finally, “exception” does not work since it does not have a pair.</p>

Both a “stickler” and a “disciplinarian” are strict people, so these are the correct answer choices. “Educator” and “scholar” are words that are associated with teachers, but they don’t mean strict.

          <p>For as long as humans have been philosophizing about the mind, virtually every thinkerhas conceived of the mind as a unitary entity. In fact, such a view was crucial to both Aristotle’sand Descartes’s view that the mind (or the soul) survived death. Surely the self cannot besubdivided; surely one cannot have half a mind? Indeed, the final evidence that one can, in fact, have “half a mind” came in the 1960s,from the famous studies for which Roger Sperry was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1981 for hisdiscoveries about the functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres. Working withepileptics who had been treated via the cutting of the <i>corpus callosum</i>, or division between thetwo hemispheres, Sperry was able to observe “odd behavior” in these patients—each half of the brain could gain new information, but one hemisphere was entirely unaware of what theother had learned or experienced. control different abilities, and that those “modules” can operate independently. As we caneasily see from patients with brain damage, there is no “unified mind and personality”—partof ourselves, centered in different parts of the brain, can change or be obliterated entirely asa result of physical changes to the brain. Consider the case of Phineas Gage, a rail worker who,in 1848, while attempting to compress explosive powder with a tamping rod, literally blew a hole in the front of his brain. While Gage was ultimately able to function fairly normally, hispersonality was markedly changed; he became boorish and irresponsible. Gage’s case waswell documented, allowing modern reconstructions to show that his injury affected areas ofthe brain that we now know to be related to moral sensibilities and their expression. That is,Phineas Gage literally lost one (or more) of the modules in his modular brain system.</p>

            <p>143. <b>(A).</b> The first paragraph of the passage states that oxytocin treatments are often tried in isolated cases and the overall effects are without evaluation. The passage then describes a small study that seems promising, but makes no definitive claims. Therefore, it is likely that the author would agree that the effects of oxytocin require further evaluation, supporting choice (A). Answer choice (B) is incorrect as the passage states the opposite, namely that oxytocin is</p>
            <p>not a “cure-all.” Although the author focuses on the effects of oxytocin for those who are not able to interpret social cues, answer choice (C) is incorrect as the author does not state that the drug would not be useful for those who can already do so. The author specifically addresses choice (D) in the passage, stating that the hormone oxytocin increases feelings of calm and social bonding. Finally, answer choice (E) is incorrect, as the author never addresses oxytocin as an oral treatment.</p>

          <p>Most mental health disorders and cases of drug abuse tend to diminish a person’s abilityto recognize other people’s feelings. A recent study in Norway suggests, however, that theseeffects can be bolstered by a nasal spray puff of the brain hormone oxytocin, which is knownto increase feelings of calm and social bonding. Although oxytocin is already prescribed for certain disorders that affect social function, such as autism, these treatments are often tried inisolated cases, leaving the overall effects of the drug without evaluation. researchers found that after a nasal spray dose of oxytocin, the students’ awareness of theexpressions was intensified. Further, the experiment showed that the oxytocin had the greatesteffect on those who were least able to evaluate emotions properly when given the control. addiction.

            <p>(A)The results of the study are inconclusive because a sample set of 40 students is not substantial.</p>

            <p>144. <b>(D).</b> The second paragraph states that “the experiment showed that the oxytocin had the greatest affect on those who were least able to evaluate emotions properly when given the control.” Thus, it can be inferred that those with the least ability to naturally infer emotions, in other words, the ones who might need it most, reaped the greatest benefits of the hormone. This matches choice (D). Additionally, (A) is incorrect as the passage does not discuss inconclusiveness based on sample size. Choice (B) is incorrect as it incorrectly pairs the known effects of the hormone in the brain with the results of the student study. Choice (C) is incorrect as the passage does not address the ability of the students to recognize expressions, just the relative change between the controlled salt water dose and the oxytocin. Finally, choice (E) is incorrect for a similar reason: the passage does not state that the subtler the expression the more difficult it was for students to identify, just that some expressions that were used were subtler than others.</p>

            <p>51. <b>(B).</b> This question is a disguised inference question; when the passage consists of premises, the correct choice must follow directly from those premises and not require any additional assumptions. Here, the issue is how to minimize the spread of flu via air travel.</p>
            <p>(A) The passage states that the infection can be spread by coughing. The flu virus, therefore, can reach the other passengers in the “closely packed environment” before it enters any filters that might kill the virus.</p>
            <p><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> Vaccines provide significant protection against developing the virus (not 100% protection, but the question concerns minimizing the impact of air travel, not eliminating it entirely). If all passengers are vaccinated against the virus, many of those who otherwise would have developed the disease will not, and, therefore, will not spread it to others.</p>
            <p>(C) Anyone can contract the virus and subsequently spread it; the mentioned populations are merely “especially vulnerable” to it. Infected people traveling to another place can infect children, senior citizens, and others who have stayed in their home regions.</p>
            <p>(D) The passage states that the infection can be spread by coughing; while it may be true that the virus can also spread via hand contact, this information is not stated in the passage.</p>
            <p>(E) The passage states that people who develop symptoms before travel begins likely would not make the trip; banning those with observable symptoms will not “minimize” the role of air travel because there are not that many people in this category. The larger danger is those who may be infected but have not yet developed symptoms.</p>

            <p>52. <b>(B).</b> The journalist cites data about the success of tall people, then concludes that employers have an unconscious bias in favor of tall people. The journalist assumes that employer bias is the only explanation for the data; the correct choice will question this explanation.</p>
            <p>(A) Irrelevant. Gender comparisons are irrelevant to the journalist’s data on CEOs, since those data are only about male CEOs. Likewise, gender comparisons are irrelevant in interpreting the journalist’s data about the general population, since the passage says those data have been corrected for the influence of gender and age.</p>
            <p><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> If socioeconomic status is correlated to both height and educational attainment, you would expect taller people to be, on average, better educated. The economic success of tall people could then be attributed to their higher levels of educational attainment rather than to employer bias.</p>
            <p>(C) Irrelevant. Professional basketball players, with their above average height and above average pay, only account for a small part of the correlation between height and pay. And insofar as height is useful in the game of basketball, the high wages of tall players can be explained without reference to any unconscious bias on the part of their employers.</p>
            <p>(D) Irrelevant. An HR professional might unconsciously favor tall people (or good-looking people, or charismatic people, etc.) without being tall (or good-looking, or charismatic, etc.).</p>
