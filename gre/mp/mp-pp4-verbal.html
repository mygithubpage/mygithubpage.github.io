            <p>19. <b>Insensibly.</b> The phrase “once considered” suggests that whatever follows is no longer thought to be true, so the blank will oppose the clue “capable of genuine imitation” and go along with the idea that the bearded dragons were thought to be acting “without understanding the action’s deeper significance.” An appropriate choice, then, will mean something like “mindlessly.” “Listlessly” means unenergetically, while “actively” means the opposite. “Consciously” is a reversal trap. To do something “attentively” means to do so with great interest. This leaves “insensibly,” which means unaware or incapable of perception.</p>

            <p>20. <b>Coda.</b> There are two possibilities for the blank: something like a bad ending (yet another bad event occurred in December) or something like an inconvenience (relative to the other “devastating” events). A “coda” is an ending that sums up what came before, which, in this case, was pretty bad. A “rampage” is bad but does not fit grammatically before the word “to,” nor does it correctly describe an earthquake—rather, murderers or mobs go on rampages. A “prologue” would be at the beginning of the year, not at the end. “Catharsis” means an emotional release and doesn’t fit the context of a natural disaster, which would build up emotional distress rather than release it. And finally, “homily” is a lecture, sometimes religious, but this doesn’t fit the context of a natural disaster.</p>

            <p>21. <b>Presciently, simpatico.</b> The sentence indicates that the two writers very much thought alike. “Presciently” means seeing into the future or as though seeing into the future, which is exactly what the writers were able to do while anticipating each other’s letters. “Ominously” puts too negative of a spin on the anticipation, and “anachronistically,” which means out of time, does not fit the context of the sentence. “Simpatico” matches the idea of being of one mind better than “providential,” favorable or auspicious, or “shrewd.”</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>22. <b>Inured to.</b> “Casting a blind eye to” suffering means that these people ignore or pretend not to see the suffering. Thus, they are “inured to” suffering—they are hardened and desensitized as a result of seeing so much of it. Trap answer “exempted” would mean that the people described are no longer personally subject to the suffering, which the sentence does not indicate. Because they ignore suffering, they also wouldn’t be “maudlin” or “effusive,” which are about expressing strong feelings. Finally, “dominant over” does not fit idiomatically since you can’t become dominant over suffering.</p>

            <p>23. <b>Coalesced.</b> Since the group overcame the “struggle over power” and became “a harmonious team,” the blank needs a word that means came together. “Coalesced” matches perfectly and is the correct answer. “Agglomerated” is a bit of a trap—to agglomerate is to collect or form into a mass or group. Since the people were already in a group, the word is inappropriate (agglomerate is also used more for things than for people). “Fractured” is the opposite of coming together. The other options are difficult words but are used in contexts very different than group harmony: “syncopated” means either the shortening of a word or the displacement of beats in a musical piece and “amortized” means reducing a debt.</p>

The newcomers were happy with the show, so the long-time fans must have been unhappy: they thought that “the storyline” was “unfinished.” Only “considered” matches this meaning. “Appreciated” is a reversal trap.

            <p>19. <b>Diversity, mutation.</b> The geneticists mentioned are studying a population descended from a rather small number of people a rather long time ago. Geneticists—who study genes, of course—would be interested in how the genes of this population changed over time. Therefore, “the study of” both genetic “diversity” and genetic “mutation” appropriately fit the blank. “Revivification,” which means the restoration of life, and “rejuvenation” do not fit because this sentence is not about bringing ancient people back to life. “Therapy” and “history” have the wrong meanings.</p>

            <p>20. <b>Triage, prioritize.</b> The words for the blank should match the clue “to metaphorically separate the wheat from the chaff.” (Chaff is the inedible part of wheat that is discarded before the wheat can be made into flour, so this expression means to separate out the useful and non-useful, or important and unimportant, parts of something.) You can also use the clues regarding “the only way that a person can function” given an “influx of information.” “Delete” and “eliminate” are attractive traps but don’t match the idea of separating the important parts from the unimportant. Only “triage” (think of what emergency room nurses do) and “prioritize” match. “Respond” and “requite,” which means to reciprocate, are not good fits.</p>

The pair “obsequiously” and “sycophantically,” which both mean fawning or in an excessively deferential manner, are the opposite of what the blank requires. “Inadvertently,” which means accidentally, and “idiosyncratically,” which means individualistic, can’t be correct because they don’t have matches.</p>

Since the sentence also says that paints contained poisons, you need two words that mean something like surprising or surprisingly large. The correct answers, “a flabbergasting” and “a confounding” both mean surprising. Trap answers “incomprehensible” and “impossible” go too far—it’s interesting that many painters had long lives, but it’s not beyond all comprehension. “Dismaying” is incorrect because it isn’t upsetting that many painters lived long lives. Although apparently contradictory information might be “enlightening,” that word has no match and cannot be correct.</p>

Remember not to insert your own opinions—“eccentric” and “idiosyncratic” are near-synonyms, but are a trap. “Prosperous” and “affluent” also form a tempting trap, because they could both describe someone who is “newly rich,” but they do not mean “showy.”</p>

To “galvanize” is to shock or excite into action and to “amalgamate” is to combine, so neither of these words fits with the idea of moderating. To “abridge” is to shorten, but shortening the expression of one’s views does not make them more moderate.</p>

          <p>Timelines are one of the most commonplace classroom tools used to teach history.They present a concise chronology with dates and events listed in a linear narrative, forminga skeletal story of history. Despite their usefulness in allowing students to gain a cursoryknowledge of many key moments in the past, their bare-bones, fact-centered structure is symptomatic of the myopic character of curricula that emphasize the What, When, and Whoand eclipse the significance of Why and How. . This timeline has photos accompanying it—about 5–6 per panel—next to most of thedates, and below each date is a 1–2 line description of an event that took place in that year.What immediately commands one’s attention when looking at this timeline are the datesthemselves. Bolder and more prominently placed than anything else, they seem to be the mostimportant feature of the timeline—even more so than the events’ descriptions. The way the dates line up in perfect order presents the viewer with a rigid historical narrative, completewith a beginning and end. historical significance to qualify as one of only 64 pieces of American history presented, thoughno event’s entry gives even a vague explanation as to why it merits this. The second messagethe timeline conveys, simply by hanging in the classroom, is that this version of history is an“official” one. Third, that each of these events happened totally independently of one another.Fourth, that, at most, only one significant event occurred in any given year. And finally, that American history is entirely made up of wars and minor battles, punctuated by the occasionalpresidential election and technological innovation. Now, certainly, one can easily surmise thatthe timeline authors are not consciously promoting these implications, and instead assumethat the viewer will automatically acknowledge that it is not a comprehensive history butrather a simple summary of selected events through time. The danger of using the timeline as a teaching tool, of course, lies squarely in that assumption.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="C">
            <p>27. <b>(C).</b> “Myopic” means nearsighted, and the author employs it to describe the inability of some curricula to show the big picture. Similarly, “purblind,” choice (C), means “partially blind or deficient in understanding.” Choices (A), (B), and (D) are not justified by evidence from the passage. Ignorance and bigotry are not mentioned as problems. “Astigmatic” indicates visual distortion, but the passage spoke of missing elements. “Mordant,” meaning caustic or corrosive, has no connection to the passage.</p>

            <p>Which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the conclusion drawn above?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)While music courses are often included in elementary school curricula, such classes are rarely taught in high school.</p>
            <p>(B)On international tests of complex math skills, high school students in this country performed no worse than did their counterparts from countries in which problem solving is emphasized in higher grades.</p>
            <p>(C)When presented with a math problem to solve, students in higher grades are more likely to arrive at different answers than students in lower grades.</p>
            <p>(D)Older students tend to receive higher grades in math than younger students do.</p>
            <p>(E)Universities in this country report a steady increase in the percentage of first-year students who qualify to take courses such as engineering that require advanced math.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>8. <b>(E).</b> The conclusion of the argument is that “[n]ew methods of math education in this country do a disservice to our children.” Why? Because math teachers emphasize “the same narrow, skills-based approach” in higher grades “that students learned in lower grades rather than the analytical tools that they will need to solve complex math problems.” To weaken the conclusion, show that this approach has not had a negative effect on children’s math skills.</p>
            <p>(A) Music is used simply as an analogy in the argument. It has no effect on the conclusion.</p>
            <p>(B) The argument suggests that students are getting worse at advanced math skills due to new methods of teaching. This answer choice provides no basis for evaluating students’ math performance over time; performing “no worse than” students from other countries provides no information about students’ performance prior to the introduction of the new teaching methods.</p>
            <p>(C) The simple fact that older students arrive at different answers does not address the concerns of the argument, which is that students are not prepared for higher-level math.</p>
            <p>(D) The fact that older students receive better grades in math does not address the concerns of the argument, which is that students are not prepared for higher-level math.</p>
            <p><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> This choice states that an increasing percentage of native first-year students qualify to take college courses requiring advanced math. This suggests that more children are prepared for advanced math than had previously been the case, thus weakening the conclusion of the argument.</p>

        <div id="passage2" class="passage">
          <p>New methods of math education in this country do a disservice to our children. In the lower grades, math instruction should focus on the basic skills that students will need to solve complex problems in higher grades. Learning basic math skills is like learning the scales and chords that one will later use to master complicated concertos and symphonies. Increasingly, math educators in this country seem to have it backward, emphasizing in higher grades the same narrow, skills-based approach that students learned in lower grades rather than the analytical tools that they will need to solve complex math problems.</p>

            <p>9. <b>(B).</b> The first boldface sentence states that the fight against the drug trade in Country X “should focus for the time being on tightening the country’s borders and targeting major smugglers.” The second boldface sentence states that the United Nations and the government of Country X should eventually replace the poppy fields with other farming ventures (“agricultural infrastructure”). The correct choice will describe the function of each sentence in the argument. The first sentence is a shorter-term conclusion and the second sentence is a longer-term conclusion of the argument.</p>
            <p>(A) This choice states that the first sentence is the conclusion and that the second sentence is an alternative to that conclusion. This misrepresents the relationship. The first sentence is a shorter-term conclusion and the second sentence is a longer-term conclusion of the argument.</p>
            <p><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> This choice states that the first sentence is a short-term solution to a problem and the second a long-term solution to the same problem. This accurately describes the relationship.</p>
            <p>(C) This choice states that the first sentence presents a problem. According to the text, however, the first sentence is not a problem but rather is a solution to a problem.</p>
            <p>(D) No information was given about the popularity of the solution, so this is incorrect.</p>
            <p>(E) The first sentence does present an argument, but the second sentence, rather than providing evidence, presents a second argument.</p>

            <p>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the claim made about urban waterfront properties?</p>

          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)People today have more money, relatively speaking, to spend on real estate than they did in previous centuries.</p>

            <p>(C)Many urban waterfront lots are available for purchase.</p>
            <p>(D)Many coastal cities are encouraging developers to rehabilitate the waterfront through tax incentives.</p>
            <p>(E)Properties in interior residential districts in coastal cities are significantly more expensive than those along the waterfront.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="B">
            <p>10. <b>(B).</b> The conclusion is that a “developer who wishes to make a large profit would be wise to buy urban waterfront lots and erect residential buildings on them.” The basis for that claim is that people pay large sums for beach front homes. The question asks for the choice that strengthens that conclusion.</p>
            <p>(A) This choice states that people have more buying power today than in previous centuries. This does not strengthen the claim that a developer will make money on urban waterfront properties.</p>
            <p><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> This choice states that homeowners will be willing to spend large sums of money on residential properties in traditionally industrial or commercial districts. Since the argument states that urban waterfronts have traditionally been industrial, this fact strengthens the claim that a developer can make a profit on urban waterfront properties.</p>
            <p>(C) This choice states that many urban waterfront lots are available for purchase. This does not suggest, however, that a developer will be able to sell them profitably.</p>
            <p>(D) This choice states that many coastal cities are giving tax breaks to developers who rehabilitate the waterfront, but this does not suggest that anyone will buy the developed properties.</p>
            <p>(E) This choice states that properties in the interior of cities are more expensive than those on the waterfront. Although waterfront properties are therefore cheaper to acquire, this does not necessarily mean that a developer can make a profit after buying such properties.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="passage4" class="passage">
          <p> In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was believed by many in coastal cities of the United States that the waterfront was an undesirable location for residential buildings. As a result, much of the waterfront in these cities was never developed aesthetically and instead was left to industry and commerce. Today, however, waterfront properties are generally seen as prestigious, as evidenced by the large sums paid for homes along the beach front. A developer who wishes to make a large profit would be wise to buy urban waterfront lots and erect residential buildings on them.</p>
