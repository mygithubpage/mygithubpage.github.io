            <p>79. <b>Congenial, erode.</b> When a relationship goes from something to “chilly at best,” the relationship used to be warm or cordial: “congenial” fits best for the first blank. “Peaceful” doesn’t go far enough, and “reverent” goes too far. If the relationship has gotten worse, then there has been an undermining, or an eroding, of mutual trust. To “bolster” something is to support or to improve it, so this choice is opposite to the desired meaning. “Fester” (not improve and likely get worse over time) is a negative word; something positive, such as “trust,” cannot be said to “fester.” Only something negative, such as a wound or resentment, can be described as “festering.”</p>

            <p>80. <b>Anomalies.</b> The opening phrase “It is in no way shocking that” suggests that whatever follows will at first appear to be “shocking.” The second part of the sentence provides another clue when it says “however” other scientists must be able to “duplicate the normal pattern” of the original experiment in order to consider its results valid. So the blank must be filled by a word that describes results that deviate from what is expected, such as the correct answer “anomalies.” Although “anxiety” and “malfunctions” might be unexpected outcomes of scientific experiments, they do not fit with the second part of the sentence and so are not correct. “Vaccines” and “paradigms,” or models, are expected outcomes of scientific experiments and so cannot be correct either.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="AEG">
            <p>81. <b>Responsible for, eschews, fundamental.</b> Your first clue is “free will.” One can only be “responsible for” the things one decides, or freely wills, to do. Judgments of people might well be “determined by” or “based on” something that they have done, but such judgments would be an outcome of determining responsibility, not the responsibility itself. For the second blank, the word “instead,” even though it occurs later in the sentence, implies that Dr. Wegner is avoiding “the traditional talking points of the controversy.” He “eschews” them. There is nothing in the sentence to suggest that Dr. Wegner “mitigates” (reduces the severity of) or “contradicts” the points that are usually made when “free will” is discussed. The word “though” indicates that the third blank contrasts with the word “tangential.” A “tangential” question is one that is related to the issue but not at its core, so such a question would usually be regarded as less important to answer. The third blank, then, should mean something like at the core of the issue, or “fundamental.” There is nothing in the sentence to suggest that the question is “ideological” (strongly related to a particular belief system or ideology) or “flashy.”</p>

            <p>82. <b>Detractors, fealty, tantamount to.</b> “Erstwhile” means past or former, indicating that those who are now “gathering around” the candidate were once doing something different—that is, criticizing or detracting. The correct answer for the first blank must be “detractors.” “Supporters” and “zealots” (fanatical supporters) are the reverse of what you want and are there to trap anyone who doesn’t notice the word “erstwhile.” These former “detractors” are “gathering around her” to proclaim their loyalty, or “fealty,” in a way that is deeply inconsistent with their past actions, as they are “behaving in a manner” that one might call “outright hypocrisy.” They are not proclaiming their “distaste” or “magnanimity,” which means generosity, especially from a former opponent. Since the last sentence says that the former opponents didn’t feel at all embarrassed about behavior that might be described “as _________ outright hypocrisy,” the third blank must mean equivalent to or the same as, which is exactly what “tantamount to” means. Neither “reciprocal with” (an equal exchange with) nor “hinging on” (dependent on) fit the desired meaning here.</p>

            <p>83. <b>Convulsions, retching.</b> This sentence contrasts various symptoms of exposure to toxic substances. The two blanks must contrast with “lassitude” (tiredness) and “torpor” (sluggishness) because of the word “whereas.” Additionally, the word “incite” indicates that the blanks will contain words that are active rather than passive. Although “convulsions” (violent seizures) and “retching” are not opposites of “lassitude” and “torpor,” these are the only choices that might be active symptoms of poisoning. “Quarrels” (arguments) and “complaints” are not symptoms of poisoning. Incorrect choices “apathy” and “drowsiness” are somewhat similar to “lassitude” and “torpor” and are therefore the opposite of what you want.</p>

            <p>84. <b>Wag.</b> The sentence concerns “Commentators and comedians.” Since defining a “gaffe” (a mistake) “as a politician accidentally telling the truth” is meant to be funny, the blank needs to be a word for a comedian. A “wag” is a joker, although not necessarily a professional one, and a decent match. An “apologist” would be a supporter who made excuses for the corrupt politicians; this doesn’t fit the meaning of the sentence as a whole. A “diplomat” also wouldn’t be likely to publicly say something so impolite about politicians. And finally, although a comedian could also be an “egoist” (self-centered person) or “transgressor” (violator of rules), these words are not synonyms for “commentators and comedians.”</p>

            <p>79. <b>Exacerbate, magnify.</b> While many people think antibiotics are great for everything (“a cure-all”), they can “actually” make the problem worse: they could “strengthen bacterial strains,” which is a bad thing. The two best answer choices are “exacerbate” and “magnify.” “Ameliorate,” or make better, is the exact opposite and so is incorrect. “Differentiate,” to distinguish, doesn’t fit the meaning either. “Distort” would mean that the problem is changed but not necessarily made worse. “Pathologize,” which means to view something as medically or psychologically unhealthy, is a tempting trap, as a bacterial infection is a an unhealthy condition, but the meaning doesn’t match the idea of making a problem worse.</p>

The blank, then, must be filled with a word describing how teachers are “in fact” likely to behave: not able or likely to change. Both “impervious” and “inimical” fit this meaning. “Amenable” and “prone” are not a true pair, nor do they match with the observations of how teachers actually behave. “Reconciled” and “resigned” are a pair that would mean the teachers are changing their behavior, but the sentence indicates that this is not so.</p>

Thus, choice (B) is correct. As for (A), the passage never states that either theory is superior to the other. Although (C) is true, the passage only mentions the two models of the solar system as an example of the workings of explanationism. Therefore, it cannot be the main idea of the passage.

            <p>92 <b>(E).</b> Before citing the example of the Copernicus and Brahe models of the universe, the author states in the first paragraph that “it could be the case that a theory predicts something and yet does not provide the best explanation of it.” The author goes on to use Copernicus and Brahe as an example, stating that both of their theories have predictive power, but Brahe’s does not offer the best explanation for the workings of the solar system. This supports choice (E). As for (A), the author is actually arguing the opposite: that predictive power alone is never enough to verify a theory. Regarding (B), the author does reveal that some theories have more or less of an ad hoc quality, but this is not the author’s reason for citing this example. The main reason must be related back to explanationism. As</p>
            <p>for (C), the example showed the opposite—both theories were found to accurately predict future events, and thus they must have both made the same predictions for those future events.

          <p>Explanationism is the idea that prediction is, in itself, insufficient to confirm a theory. Toadequately confirm a theory, according to an explanationist, is to see how well it describesevents and phenomena that have already been observed. Stephen Brush, a staunchexplanationist, would say that a correct prediction does not necessarily confirm the truth of a theory; it could be the case that a theory predicts something and yet does not provide the bestexplanation of it. Take, for example, the difference in the perspectives of Copernicus and Braheon the solar system. Copernicus’s model of the solar system was heliocentric, positing that allof the planets revolved around the sun. Brahe’s theory stated that all of the planets revolvedaround the sun, <i>except</i> the earth, which was immobile, and that the sun actually revolved around the earth. Even if both accurately predicted future movements of the planets, it iseasy to see how Copernicus’s theory has less of an “ad hoc” quality—and, of course, providesa superior explanation of the mechanisms of the solar system. It is certainly true that a theorycan successfully predict a certain event, yet fail to provide an adequate explanation for why ithappened, or perhaps even stumble on the prediction more by accident than by manner of understanding the mechanism behind the event. posit that all solids will sink if they are placed in a liquid of the same element, because the solidis denser than the liquid. Given this premise, we discover that the physicist’s prediction is true,and even once he stages an experiment with ice and water, he will not be proven wrong, butrather will have discovered a unique property of solid water.</p>

This supports choice (E). As for (A), the author is actually arguing the opposite: that predictive power alone is never enough to verify a theory.

            <p>93. <b>1st and 2nd only.</b> The words “for example” at the beginning of the sentence containing the crowd analogy follow a sentence about the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle says that fermions cannot “inhabit the same fundamental state.” Electrons, which are fermions, are likened to members of a crowd in a stadium; the fact that electrons cannot “circle the nuclei of atoms in precisely the same orbits” (just as crowd members cannot sit on top of one another) is a “consequence” of the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus, the first statement is justified. These electrons “must occupy more and more distant locations”; the crowd analogy certainly illustrates that behavior, so the second statement is justified. As for the third, incorrect statement, while it is true that electrons cannot occupy the same orbits as one another and must instead occupy more and more distant locations, you do not know that those orbits are “concentric” or “evenly spaced.”</p>

          <p>Subatomic particles can be divided into two classes: fermions and bosons, terms coinedby physicist Paul Dirac in honor of his peers Enrico Fermi and Satyendra Bose. Fermions, whichinclude electrons, protons, and neutrons, obey the Pauli exclusion principle, according to whichno two particles can inhabit the same fundamental state. For example, electrons cannot circle the nuclei of atoms in precisely the same orbits, loosely speaking, and thus must occupy moreand more distant locations, like a crowd filling seats in a stadium. The constituents of ordinarymatter are fermions; indeed, the fact that fermions are in some sense mutually exclusive is themost salient reason why two things composed of ordinary matter cannot be in the same placeat the same time. Conversely, bosons, which include photons (particles of light) and the hitherto elusiveHiggs boson, do not obey the Pauli principle and in fact tend to bunch together in exactlythe same fundamental state, as in lasers, in which each photon proceeds in perfect lockstepwith all the others. Interestingly, the seemingly stark division between fermionic and bosonicbehavior can be bridged. All particles possess “spin,” a characteristic vaguely analogous to that of a spinning ball; boson spins are measured in integers, such as 0 and 1, while fermion spinsare always half-integral, such as ½ and 1½. As a result, whenever an even number of fermionsgroup together, that group of fermions, with its whole-number total spin, effectively becomesa giant boson. Within certain metals chilled to near absolute zero, for instance, so-calledCooper pairs of electrons form; these pairs flow in precise harmony and with zero resistance through the metal, which is thus said to have achieved a superconductive condition. Similarly,helium-4 atoms (composed of 2 electrons, 2 protons, and 2 neutrons) can collectively displayboson-like activity when cooled to a superfluid state. A swirl in a cup of superfluid helium will,amazingly, never dissipate. the corollary question of whether groups of bosons can ever exhibit fermionic characteristics.Some scientists argue for the existence of skyrmions (after the theorist Tony Skyrmewho first described the behavior of these hypothetical fermion-like groups of bosons)in superconductors and other condensed-matter environments, where twists in the structure ofthe medium might permit skyrmions to form.</p>

As for (A), the passage states that an even number of fermions (which, according to the first paragraph, “include electrons, protons, and neutrons”) constitute a boson, but not an odd number (½ integer times an odd will not give an integer).

            <p>34. <b>(D).</b> Farmers in developing countries claim that the global price of wheat is low because American farmers produce too much of the grain. They also claim that American farmers produce too much wheat because they have no incentive to manage their crops, since the U.S. government will buy any surplus wheat. The question asks which choice weakens the claim that removing the American subsidy would cause the price of wheat to rise.</p>
            <p>(A) The fact that there are uses for wheat that is not eaten is irrelevant. This does not address the farmers’ claims.</p>
            <p>(B) That buyers of wheat can predict their needs in advance is irrelevant, because the text indicates that American farmers do not pay attention to actual demand for wheat.</p>
            <p>(C) In this argument, the global market for soybeans is irrelevant to the global market for wheat, which is a different commodity with different demand, supply, and pricing structures.</p>

          <p> Farmers in developing countries claim that the U.S. government, through farm subsidies, is responsible for the artificially low global price of wheat. Because the U.S. government buys whatever wheat American farmers are unable to sell on the open market, American farmers have no incentive to modulate the size of their crops according to the needs of the global market. As a result, American farmers routinely produce more wheat than the global market can absorb and the global price of wheat is kept low. Without these subsidies, the farmers in developing economies claim, American farmers would produce only the amount of wheat that they could sell on the open market and the global price of wheat would rise.</p>
