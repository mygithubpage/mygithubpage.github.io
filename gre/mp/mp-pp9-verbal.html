            <p>49. <b>A deplorable.</b> This sentence begins with the expression “For all,” an idiomatic way of saying “despite.” The second half of the sentence, then, should contradict the “meticulous preparation” reported in the first half: the student’s grade must have been bad. “Passable” wouldn’t do the job here—it would suggest a decent but not fantastic grade—and “outstanding” is the exact opposite of what you want. “Exacting” means demanding, and while the test must have been exacting on the student, his grade could not be described as such. “Surprising” is the most pernicious option, because the student was likely very surprised by a grade that did not reflect the work he put into studying; this choice does not make clear, however, that the student’s grade was terrible. “Deplorable,” on the other hand, fits the bill—it means surprisingly bad.</p>

            <p>50. <b>Informed.</b> The clue “Just as” indicates that the second part of the sentence will need to mirror the first part. Thus, the blank must match the meaning of “provided the Romans with a model.” “Informed” can be used in this way and is the correct answer. Don’t be tricked by “duplicate” (to provide a model isn’t to make an exact copy) or “foresaw” (the remnants of Roman culture didn’t tell the future). Both “curbed” and “hindered” have too strong of a negative spin and do not mirror the first part of the sentence.</p>

            <p>51. <b>Enhances.</b> The sentence requires a word that means helps or strengthens—“enhances” is a perfect synonym for strengthen and the correct answer. Don’t fall for “ensures,” which is too extreme. Having a head that can measure spaces is cool, but hardly guarantees the success of a species. “Reproduces” is a word related to success as a species, but does not fit the blank. “Mitigate” means to make less severe, and “inundate” means to overwhelm, neither of which fit in the blank.</p>

            <p>52. <b>Guileless, canny.</b> The sentence contrasts the teacher’s “novice” appearance with what he in fact was. The second half of the sentence indicates that he understood the “byzantine” (complicated) power structures and was using the administration “to his advantage.” This suggests that he was quite sharp, making “canny” a perfect fit for blank (ii). “Unseemly” means improper, and there’s no clue in the sentence that suggests his behavior was inappropriate. “Desultory” would mean that the teacher lacked a plan, but his use of the administration would suggest otherwise. Blank (i) describes the word “novice” and helps to explain how the teacher made himself appear: the opposite of “canny.” “Cunning” has a similar meaning to canny and might be selected by someone who misses the contrast between the two blanks. There’s no reason to believe that the teacher was “capricious,” or whimsical. That leaves “guileless,” a synonym for innocent, and a perfect fit in this sentence.</p>

Neither “subtleties” nor “consistencies” fits with the clue “flawed.” If there are “significant irregularities,” then the analysis is “anything but” good.

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="BF">
            <p>54. <b>Berserk, recede.</b> There are two major clues about the middle phases of a revolution: transferring power to “less temperate” forces would cause chaos, and a more peaceful period follows the difficult times. Therefore, blank (i) needs a word that means the opposite of peaceful. “Brusque” means short but is not the opposite of peaceful, and “pacific” is a synonym of peaceful and the exact opposite of what the blank requires. That leaves “berserk,” which is the correct answer. The second sentence states that a more peaceful time comes later, so the “excesses” should become more stable. “Metastasize” means to spread, which is the opposite of what the blank requires. “Grow” has the same problem. That leaves the correct answer “recedes.” If the difficult times “recede,” then a more peaceful time arrives.</p>

            <p>49. <b>Strong suit, forté.</b> The sentence lists the many things that the director is good at, but the word “while” in this expression suggests that choreography was a weakness. The phrase “not at all” twists the meaning back in the opposite direction, so the blank requires a word like strength. “Strong suit” and “forté” both fit perfectly. “Hobby” and “pastime” are a pair, but they don’t work here, as this is clearly the director’s job. Similarly, “weakness” and “deficiency” are a pair but mean the opposite of what the sentence suggests.</p>

            <p>50. <b>Innovation, transformation.</b> “Though” indicates that the advent of carbon fiber brought something opposite to “old or adapted” technology. The blank should mean originality or change—“innovation” and “transformation” match that meaning. The opposite of a new item is an “antiquity.” The other answer choices could each be considered a positive value brought about by carbon fiber frames, but without a clue about the bike’s “flexibility,” “venerability,” or “seriousness,” none of those answer choices would fit, nor do they have a pair word.</p>

Those who do not “embrace the … values of their homeland” do worse academically, so they will be the ones to pay the “price.” What comes at a price, then, is embracing the culture of the new home. “Acculturation” and “assimilation” both mean exactly this. The incorrect pair, “alienation” and “estrangement” (separation from a group), have the opposite meaning. “Indebtedness” does not fit this sentence, since there is no reason to believe that someone owes someone else.

None of the answers suggests ridiculousness, but two answers—“specious” and “spurious”—mean the claims are false. While not synonyms, both words describe claims that are superficially attractive, but in fact false. “Sarcastic” (mocking) might be a trap for someone who misses that the claims referred to by the blank are not made by Machiavelli but by those who originally made the claims to power. “Squalid” (dirty or dishonest) doesn’t fit the sentence or match any other answer choice.

            <p>54. <b>Disingenuous, artful.</b> This sentence is difficult because the word “impressed” is used to refer to making an impression in a negative way. The defendant did not make a positive impression; rather, the sentence suggests that she came across as not as naïve as she pretended to be. “Disingenuous” means precisely that and one meaning of “artful” is deceptive. The sentence does not suggest that the woman was “innocent,” and while she might have been “accomplished,” that’s not how the jurors thought of her actions. “Guileless” is a trap since it is a synonym of both ingenuous and artless, all three of which mean innocent and without deception; this meaning, however, is the opposite of what the blank requires. Finally, “culpable” means guilty and is an attractive trap, but goes further than the clues in the sentence; the woman was not naïve, but she was not necessarily guilty.</p>

            <p>60. <b>(C).</b> The “Invisible Hand” is described in the second paragraph as the idea that “individuals pursuing their own self-interest could unintentionally create a more just society.” Choice (A) is wrong because the final result is not particularly just—this would be a better choice if the moviegoers’ actions somehow caused a benefit to people other than themselves. Choice (B) is wrong because it has little to do with selfishness or justice, but with another aspect of Smith’s writings. Choice (C) is correct because this system promotes selfishness (each student tries to sign up as quickly as possible for each class, without thinking of others), but those classes are then said to be “equitably</p>
            <p>distributed.” Choice (D) is wrong because raising prices isn’t inherently selfish, no one appears to be competing, and the end result is not particularly just. Choice (E) is wrong for the same reasons as (D).</p>

Choice (B) confuses an example given in the passage with the purpose of the passage and creates a hierarchy that the passage did not.

          <p>Fame and fortune are often associated with virtue, industry, and a host of other attributes.However, random strokes of fate often determine such success and said commonly perceivedvirtues prove irrelevant. For instance, decades after her death, Coco Chanel remains theepitome of French fashion and her name, as well as the company she founded, is known throughout the world. Yet, few realize that she, while undeniably talented, initially succeededby leveraging her status as a courtesan. As a company owner, it would be an understatementto say that she was not known for her generous treatment of her employees. During the Nazioccupation, she lived a privileged life at the Hotel Ritz and her lover at the time was a Germanintelligence operative. Conversely, there is the example of Madeleine Vionnet, a professional contemporary ofChanel. She is often credited with permanently transforming fashion through her use of thebias cut—cutting material against the grain of the fabric. In the 1930s, her gowns were worn byHollywood stars, and her standing was second to none. She was also, in many ways, an earlyfeminist, establishing largely unheard of employee benefits—such as day care and medical care—for her largely female staff. In addition, she lobbied for fashion copyright protections.When the Second World War broke out, she closed her business and simply retired. Today, sheis largely unknown outside of the fashion industry.</p>

Choice (A) is at best unknown, as her company was in operation before the war. Choice (B) is correct because the information supports the author’s theory that personal virtue is irrelevant to material success. Choice (C) comes from the wrong paragraph, as this information about Vionnet does not “highlight” anything about Chanel. Choice (D) is not supported by anything in the passage. Choice (E) is a distortion; the author mentions that Vionnet could be so thought of, but his point is merely about her personal integrity and does not address her feminist credentials.</p>

          <p>During the 1960s and ‘70s, scientists were concerned and puzzled by a large gap inthe human fossil record. The “aquatic ape theory” gained prominence as an explanation forthis gap. This theory posited that primitive humans were forced toward a littoral lifestyle bycompetition for arboreal resources. Analogies were made to seal populations, who sleep on land at night but spend most of their days in coastal waters. Proponents pointed to variousphysiological human attributes, such as bipedalism and the webbing between human toes, asextant adaptations. dolphins, this streamlining would facilitate swimming and diving. Proponents noted that theremaining body hair would match the flow of water, and extreme advocates explained thegender difference in hair by suggesting that females much more rarely ventured out of theshallows and into the putatively more dangerous forests and savannahs. unanimously rejects it as mere conjecture not only because of the lack of supporting evidencebut also because its claims do not withstand scrutiny. While bipedalism does facilitateswimming, it is even more of an advantage in terrestrial pursuits. Further, biomechanicalanalysis indicates that humans remain such inadequate swimmers that they could not sosucceed. As for hairlessness, critics point out that other semi-aquatic mammals actually have dense fur and/or barrel shaped torsos for heat retention. Today, the theory, whilestill championed by a prominent writer but non-scientist, has no serious support amongmainstream-trained paleoanthropologists.</p>
