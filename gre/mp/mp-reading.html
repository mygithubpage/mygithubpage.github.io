The saying <b>the sword is the soul of the samurai</b> is referenced early to indicate this importance. Later portions of the passage detail the tremendous effort that is put into each sword, reflecting the importance of each one.</p></div></div></div><div id="passage1" class="passage"><p class="indent1">Historians have long recognized the traditional Japanese sword, or <i>nihonto</i>, as one of the finest cutting weapons ever produced, but it has even been considered a spiritual entity. The adage “the sword is the soul of the samurai” reflects the sword's psychic importance, not only to its wielder, but also to its creator, the master smith. Not classically regarded as artists, master smiths nevertheless exerted great care in the process of creating swords, no two of which were ever forged exactly the same way. Over hundreds of hours, two types of steel were repeatedly heated, hammered, and folded together into thousands of subtle layers, yielding both a razor-sharp, durable edge and a flexible, shock-absorbing blade. Commonly, though optionally, the smith physically signed the blade; moreover, each smith's secret forging techniques left an idiosyncratic structural signature. Each unique finished product reflected the smith's personal honor and devotion to craft, and today, the Japanese sword is valued as much for its artistic merit as for its historical significance.</p></div><div id="question2" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage1"><div class="question"><p><b>2.

This question requires attention to both the general Point of the passage and specific details throughout.</p><p class="body-text">(A) The opening sentence says: <b>Historians have long recognized the traditional Japanese sword…as one of the finest cutting weapons ever produced</b>; however, there is no indication that the Japanese sword is the <b>most</b> important handheld weapon in history.</p><p class="body-text">(B) This passage does not discuss the skill of the samurai warrior.</p><p class="body-text"><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> According to the passage, every master smith had a <b>structural signature</b> due to his own secret forging process.

However, the passage does not say whether all master smiths are currently <b>known</b>. Certain swords with a structural signature may be of unknown origin.</p><p class="body-text">(D) The second sentence mentions the saying <b>the sword is the soul of the samurai</b>, but you are not told that the structural signature was the aspect of the sword reflecting the soul of the samurai who wielded it. The second paragraph explains that the sword <b>reflected the</b><b><b>smith's</b></b><b>personal honor and devotion to craft</b>.

One sentence mentions that <b>no two [swords] were ever forged in exactly the same way</b>. Later, <b>structural signature</b> and <b>unique finished product</b> reinforce this point.</p><p class="body-text">(D) The passage explains that master smiths were not considered artists in the classical sense, and then goes on to point out the painstaking creation of each sword. This implicitly draws a parallel between the creation of the sword and classical artistry. However, the passage does not actually describe or discuss classical artists, nor does it set forth criteria for classical artists. There is no actual comparison to classical artists, despite the mention of <b>artistic merit</b>.

Avoid answer choices that address limited sections of the passage. The Point: Sarnoff was responsible for introducing television to the public and establishing a dominant paradigm. This is foreshadowed when Sarnoff is called <b>the father of television</b>.</p><p class="body-text">(A) Farnsworth's influence on the development of the television itself is only mentioned in the first paragraph; Farnsworth's role in developing programs is never mentioned.</p><p class="body-text">(B) The impact of television is not discussed until the second paragraph. Although this paragraph debates whether or not Sarnoff's influence was a positive one, it does not address the influence of television on popular culture.</p><p class="body-text">(C) Vladimir Zworykin is only mentioned briefly in the first paragraph, so he is clearly not the primary subject of the passage. Furthermore, even though the passage mentions the initial public perception, it says nothing about the current public perception of Zworykin.</p><p class="body-text">(D) The passage discusses events that occurred after the invention; there is no mention of the events that led up to the invention of the television.</p><p class="body-text"><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> This answer includes the main elements of both paragraphs; it functions as a good summary of the entire passage.</p></div></div></div><div id="passage2" class="passage"><p class="indent1">Perhaps Sarnoff simply adapted his business ideas from other industries such as newspapers, for instance, replacing the revenue from subscriptions and newsstand purchases with that of television set sales, but Sarnoff promoted himself as a visionary. Some critics argue that Sarnoff's construct has damaged programming content. Others contend that it merely created a democratic platform allowing audiences to choose the programming they desire.</p><p class="indent1">In the early years of television, Vladimir Zworykin was considered its inventor, at least publicly. His loudest champion was his boss David Sarnoff, the president of RCA and the “father of television,” as he was and is widely regarded. Modern historians agree that Philo Farnsworth, a self-educated prodigy who was the first to transmit live images, was television's technical inventor. But Farnsworth's contributions have gone relatively unnoticed, since it was Sarnoff, not Farnsworth, who put televisions into living rooms and, even more importantly, who successfully borrowed from the radio industry the paradigm of advertiser-funded programming, a paradigm still dominant today. In contrast, Farnsworth lacked business savvy and was unable to realize his dream of television as an educational tool.</p></div><div id="question9" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question"><p><b>2.

The correct answer must follow from at least one of those statements.</p><p class="body-text">(A) You have been given no information about the television programs Sarnoff and Zworykin produced; in fact, you have not been told that they produced television shows. The paragraph is about the advertising revenue construct Sarnoff implemented, not about the television shows he produced.</p><a id="page_143" /><p class="body-text">(B) It is implied that ratings for educational programs are, in general, not strong, but that does not mean that any one particular educational program cannot have higher ratings than one particular sports program. Beware of answer choices that contain absolutes such as <b>cannot</b>.</p><p class="body-text"><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> You are told that <b>some critics argue that Sarnoff's paradigm has damaged programming content</b>. Since the word is <b>some</b>, it must be true that others feel it has played either a positive role or a neutral role. A group of these critics is mentioned in the last sentence of the paragraph.</p><p class="body-text">(D) The passage does not differentiate programming based on what time television shows air, nor does it mention profitability.</p><p class="body-text">(E) The word “should” implies a moral judgment, and the answer is therefore out of the scope of the passage. The second paragraph does not indicate a belief as to who should influence programming choices.</p></div></div></div><div id="question10" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question"><p><b>3.

Two sections in the passage discuss ways in which the television industry brought in revenue. The first paragraph mentions <b>advertiser-funded programming</b>. The second paragraph states that Sarnoff borrowed from other business models by <b>replacing the revenue from subscriptions and newsstand purchases with that of television set sales</b>.</p><p class="body-text">(A) This answer choice does not account for the revenue generated from selling television sets.</p><p class="body-text"><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> Advertising and the sale of television sets are the two ways mentioned through which the industry could generate revenue.</p><p class="body-text">(C) Subscriptions are mentioned as a method for newspapers to earn revenue; the last paragraph clearly states that television replaced this revenue with that earned by selling the sets themselves.</p><p class="body-text">(D) This choice does not mention advertising revenue; moreover, it incorrectly mentions subscription revenue.</p><p class="body-text">(E) This answer choice incorrectly mentions subscription revenue.</p><a id="page_144" /></div></div></div><div id="question11" data-choice-type="select" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question"><p><b>4.

There are two plausible candidates. First, the second-to-last sentence of the first paragraph says that Sarnoff <b>successfully borrowed from the radio industry the paradigm of advertiser-funded programming</b>. This sentence states a fact indicating that Sarnoff took a business model from another medium, which would be imitative rather than innovative.</p><p class="body-text">The second possible answer is the first sentence of the second paragraph, which says: <b>Perhaps Sarnoff simply adapted his business ideas from other industries such as newspapers</b>. However, the use of the word “perhaps” means that this is an idea of the author's, rather than a statement of fact. For this reason, this cannot be the answer.</p><p class="body-text">The correct answer is the second-to-last sentence of the first paragraph.</p></div></div></div><div id="question12" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage2"><div class="question"><p><b>5.

This one, annoyingly, does not provide any clues about where to look in the passage. Use the keywords in each statement to determine where to examine the passage.</p><p class="body-text">(A) While the last sentence says that some critics <b>argue that Sarnoff's construct has damaged programming content</b>, this is not stated as a fact, only a possible opinion. Always be careful to differentiate between opinions and facts on RC passages.</p><p class="body-text"><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> The first paragraph indicates that Farnsworth was the technical inventor of television. That paragraph also says that <b>Farnsworth's contributions have gone relatively unnoticed, since it was Sarnoff who put televisions into living rooms</b>.</p><p class="body-text">(C) Though the passage describes the ways in which both Zworykin and Farnsworth have been described as the progenitor of television, and though it makes a case that there remains a lively debate over who deserves the credit, this does not mean that there is “no way” of determining who invented the first television.

Typically, test writers will include incorrect answers that will be factually true but will describe the purpose of just one paragraph. The Point of this passage is arguably split in at least two pieces. The author wants to convey not only that two views of polygamy in Africa (those of the early scholars and of the missionaries) were <b>unfortunately</b> limited, but also that current research is addressing this limitation by examining the perspectives of the women protagonists.</p><p class="body-text">(A) Scholarly works that view polygamy positively are discussed only in the first two paragraphs of the passage.

The first two paragraphs review scholarly works that view polygamy as a sign of prestige and respect, while the third paragraph offers an opposing view. Finally, the concluding paragraph contrasts both of these perspectives with contemporary research.</p></div></div></div><div id="passage5" class="passage"><p class="indent1">Contemporary research in the social sciences has begun to focus on the protagonist's voice in the study of culture, recognizing that the views and experiences of those who take part in a given reality ought to receive close examination. This privileging of the protagonist seems appropriate, particularly given that women in Africa have often used literary productions, which feature protagonists and other “actors” undergoing ordeals and otherwise taking active part in real life, to comment on marriage, family, and gender relations.</p><p class="indent1">However, the colonial missionary voice provided consistent opposition to polygamy by viewing the practice as unethical and destructive of family life. While the Missionaries propagated this view citing the authority of the Bible, they were convinced that Africans had to be coerced into partaking in the vision of monogamy understood by the Western culture. The missionary viewpoint even included, in some instances, dictating immediate divorce in the case of newly converted men who had already contracted polygamous marriages. Unfortunately, both the missionary voice and the scholarly voice did not consider the views of African women important. Although there was some awareness that women regarded polygamy as both a curse and a blessing, the distanced, albeit scientific, perspective of an outside observer predominated both on the pulpit and in scholarly writings.</p><p class="indent1">By the 1970s, such arguments had become crystallized and popular. Many other African scholars who wrote on the subject became the new champions of this philosophy. For example, in 1983, John Mbiti proclaimed that polygamy is an accepted and respectable institution serving many useful social purposes. Similarly, G.K. Nukunya, in his paper “Polygamy as a Symbol of Status,” reiterated Mbiti's idea that a plurality of wives is a legitimate sign of affluence and power in African society.</p><p class="indent1">Polygamy in Africa has been a popular topic for social research over the past half-century; it has been analyzed by many distinguished minds and in various well-publicized works. In 1961, when Remi Clignet published his book <i>Many Wives, Many Powers</i>, he was not alone in sharing the view that in Africa co-wives may be perceived as direct and indirect sources of increased income and prestige. For instance, some observers argued that polygamous marriages are more able than monogamous marriages to produce many children, who can legitimately be seen as a form of wealth as well as of “this-world” immortality connected to the transmission of family names (as opposed to “other-world” immortality in an afterlife). Moreover, polygamy is rooted in and sanctioned by many ancient traditions, both cultural and religious; therefore, some assert that polygamy can provide a stabilizing function within societies frequently under stress from both internal and external forces.</p></div><div id="question27" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage5"><div class="question"><p><b>2.

The center of percussion can be located via simple trial and error by holding the end of a tennis racket between your finger and thumb and throwing a ball onto the strings. If the handle jumps out of your hand, then the ball has missed the center of percussion.</p><p class="indent1">However, there is one point of impact, known as the center of percussion, which causes neither motion to predominate; if a ball were to strike this point, the impact would not impart any motion to the end of the handle. The reason for this lack of motion is that the force on the upper part of the hand would be equal and opposite to the force on the lower part of the hand, resulting in no net force on the tennis players’ hand or forearm. The center of percussion constitutes a second sweet spot because a tennis player's wrist typically is placed next to the end of the racket's handle. When the player strikes the ball at the center of percussion, her wrist is jerked neither forward nor backward, and she experiences a relatively smooth, comfortable tennis stroke.</p><p class="indent1">In order to understand the physics of this second sweet spot, it is helpful to consider what would happen to a tennis racket in the moments after impact with the ball if the player's hand were to vanish at the moment of impact. The impact of the ball would cause the racket to bounce backwards, experiencing a translational motion away from the ball. The tendency of this motion would be to jerk all parts of the racket, including the end of its handle, backward, or away from the ball. Unless the ball happened to hit the racket precisely at the racket's center of mass, the racket would additionally experience a rotational motion around its center of mass—much as a penny that has been struck near its edge will start to spin. Whenever the ball hits the racket face, the effect of this rotational motion will be to jerk the end of the handle forward, towards the ball. Depending on where the ball strikes the racket face, one or the other of these motions will predominate.</p><p class="indent1">Though most tennis players generally strive to strike the ball on the racket's vibration node, more commonly known as the “sweet spot,” many players are unaware of the existence of a second, lesser-known location on the racket face, the center of percussion, that will also greatly diminish the strain on a player's arm when the ball is struck.</p></div><div id="question34" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage6"><div class="question"><p><b>2.

However, no other causes of weather phenomena are ever discussed.</p></div></div></div><div id="passage7" class="passage"><p class="indent1">During the dough-kneading process, two poppy seeds positioned next to each other eventually go their separate ways. Any early divergence or measurement error is repeatedly amplified by the mixing until the position of any seed becomes effectively unpredictable. It is this “sensitive dependence on initial conditions” and not true randomness that generates unpredictability in chaotic systems, of which one example may be the Earth's weather. According to the popular interpretation of the “Butterfly Effect,” a butterfly flapping its wings causes hurricanes. A better understanding is that the butterfly causes uncertainty about the precise state of the air. This microscopic uncertainty grows until it encompasses even hurricanes. Few meteorologists believe that we will ever be able to predict rain or shine for a particular day years in the future.</p><p class="indent1">Chaotic systems, such as a machine mixing bread dough, are characterized by both attraction and repulsion. As the dough is stretched, folded and pressed back together, any poppy seeds sprinkled in are intermixed seemingly at random. But this randomness is illusory. In fact, the poppy seeds are captured by “strange attractors,” staggeringly complex pathways whose tangles appear accidental but are in fact determined by the system's fundamental equations.</p><p class="indent1">To understand how unpredictability can arise from deterministic equations, which do not involve chance outcomes, consider the non-chaotic system of two poppy seeds placed in a round bowl. As the seeds roll to the bowl's center, a position known as a point attractor, the distance between the seeds shrinks. If, instead, the bowl is flipped over, two seeds placed on top will roll away from each other. Such a system, while still not technically chaotic, enlarges initial differences in position.</p><p class="indent1">Around 1960, mathematician Edward Lorenz found unexpected behavior in apparently simple equations representing atmospheric air flows. Whenever he reran his model with the same inputs, different outputs resulted—although the model lacked any random elements. Lorenz realized that tiny rounding errors in his analog computer mushroomed over time, leading to erratic results.

Therefore, at least some foreign companies must work under fewer restrictions than some American companies do.</p><p class="body-text">(B) Under the current terms, stem cell research is restricted for everybody in the U.S., so foreign professionals in this field would not necessarily want to come to the U.S. While it is possible that once the restrictions are lifted, American companies will want to hire more scientists and will seek them overseas, the government has only proposed to lift the restrictions; it hasn't actually done so.</p><p class="body-text">(C) This passage is about government restrictions in the U.S.; financial backing in particular is out of the scope of the argument.</p><p class="body-text">(D) You are not given any information regarding America's current or future position in terms of stem cell research. Though government restrictions and scientists switching companies could be issues related to a company's prosperity, you are given no information about how these directly affect America's position.</p><p class="body-text">(E) Though this could happen, it is impossible to conclude for certain that it will happen.</p></div></div></div><div id="passage16" class="passage"><p class="hang-nums">9.  Government restrictions have severely limited the amount of stem cell research that companies in the United States can conduct. Because of these restrictions, many U.S.-based scientists who specialize in the field of stem cell research have signed long-term contracts to work for foreign-based companies. Recently, the U.S. government has proposed lifting all restrictions on stem cell research.</p></div><div id="question56" data-choice-type="radio" data-passage="passage17"><div class="question"><p>Which of the following, if true, most weakens the conclusion of the educational experts?</p></div><div class="choices"><p>(A) Some teachers express that financial compensation is not the only factor contributing to job satisfaction and teaching performance.</p><p>(B) School districts will develop their own unique compensation structures that may differ greatly from those of other school districts.</p><p>(C) Upon leaving the teaching profession, many young, effective teachers cite a lack of opportunity for more rapid financial advancement as a primary factor in the decision to change careers.</p><p>(D) A merit-based system that bases compensation on teacher performance reduces collaboration, which is an integral component of quality instruction.</p><p>(E) In school districts that have implemented pay for performance compensation structures, standardized test scores have dramatically increased.</p></div><div class="answer" data-answer="D"><div class="explanation"><p class="body-text"><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b></p><p class="body-text">The words “weaken” and “if true” indicate that this is a Weaken the Conclusion question. Look for the conclusion made by the “educational experts.”</p><p class="body-text"><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b></p><p class="body-text">The argument is concerned with how public school teachers are compensated. According to the argument, educational experts claim that a system of teacher compensation based on performance rather than seniority would help to retain exceptional teachers and maintain quality instruction.</p><p class="body-text">What are the experts assuming? Can “performance” actually be measured in a meaningful way? Should it be based on how much the students like the teacher? A fun but incompetent teacher might be beloved by students. A challenging teacher might receive lower teacher ratings even though his students learn more.</p><p class="body-text"><b>Step 3: State the Goal</b></p><p class="body-text">The correct answer to this Weaken question will make the experts’ conclusion at least a little less likely to be valid.</p><p class="body-text"><b>Step 4: Work from Wrong to Right</b></p><p class="body-text">(A) Slash. The fact that other factors also contribute to job satisfaction and teaching performance neither weakens nor strengthens this argument. Either way, the teachers are getting paid; the issue is whether that pay should be based on performance or seniority.</p><p class="body-text">(B) Slash. Nothing in the argument indicates that one universal system of compensation must be adopted in order to implement this plan. It is very possible that several effective models of performance-based pay could be developed and implemented successfully.</p><a id="page_224" /><p class="body-text">(C) Strengthen. This choice indicates that many young, effective teachers are extremely frustrated by the traditional pay structure, in which financial advancement is directly tied to seniority. This bolsters the experts’ argument: these young but effective teachers who are leaving the profession might stay longer if they had better opportunity for advancement based on performance.</p><p class="body-text"><b>(D) CORRECT.</b> Weaken. This choice indicates that collaboration among teachers is integral to high-quality instruction and that a system of compensation based on teacher performance reduces collaboration. Thus, the effect of a merit-based system of pay might undermine quality instruction, which is one of the two stated goals of the educational experts.</p><p class="body-text1">(E) Strengthen. The educational experts’ argument in favor of performance-based compensation is bolstered if standardized test scores have dramatically risen in school districts that have instituted such pay structures.</p></div></div></div><div id="passage17" class="passage"><p class="hang-nums">10. Traditionally, public school instructors have been compensated according to seniority. Recently, the existing salary system has been increasingly criticized as an approach to compensation that rewards lackadaisical teaching and punishes motivated, highly qualified instruction. Instead, educational experts argue that, to retain exceptional teachers and maintain quality instruction, teachers should receive salaries or bonuses based on performance rather than seniority.</p></div></div></main></body></html>
