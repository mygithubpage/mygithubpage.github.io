          <p>First, read <b>only</b> the sentence. Find the clue (failed to secure the prestigious university's coveted diploma) and the pivot (despite). Write your own fill-in–here, <i>studying</i> would be a good choice. Now compare <i>studying</i> with every answer choice:</p>
          <p>studying</p>
          <p>A ✗<br />B ✗<br />C ✓<br />D ✗<br />E ~</p>
          <p>The answer is <b>(C)</b>. <i>Lucubration</i> means “intense study.”</p>

        <div class="question">
          <p>If the student had been less ________, he would not have been expelled from his grade school.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="choices">
          <p>indefatigable</p>
          <p>perseverant</p>

        <div class="explanation" data-answer="C">
          <p>Find the <u>target</u>, <u>clue</u>, and the <u>pivot</u></p>
          <p>Stating the target explicitly can help to locate the clue. Here, the target is simply <i>the student</i>. In this case, the clue is <i>expelled</i>. The sentence reads “less _______…not expelled.<i>”</i> So the pivot is <i>less…not</i>.</p>
          <p>Think about what this means. If the student were <i>less</i><span class="u">such-and-such</span>, then he would <i>not</i> have been expelled. So <span class="u">such-and-such</span> got him expelled. In other words, the blank agrees with <i>expelled. Less</i> and <i>not</i> cancel each other out as negatives.</p>
          <p>indefatigable = tireless</p>
          <p>perseverant = determined</p>
          <p>refractory = ??</p>
          <p>playful</p>
          <p>indigent = poor</p>
          <p>So now your paper might look like this:</p>
          <p>A ✗<br />B ✗<br />C ?<br />D ~<br />E ~</p>
          <p>The correct answer is in fact <b>(C)</b>, since <i>refractory</i> means “rebellious.” But even if you didn't know what <i>refractory</i> means, you would have a good shot at getting this problem right through process of elimination. Also, notice that you can write a plausible story around some of the wrong answer choices. For example, “If the student had been less <i>playful</i>, he wouldn't have been expelled.” This could make sense if the student was playing games during a serious lesson. Or maybe, “If the student had been less <i>indigent</i>, he wouldn't have been expelled.” What an indictment of the school's administration!</p>

          <p>Your fill-in for #2 should probably be <i>heckling</i>. Remember to reuse the given language in the fill-in when you can.</p>
          <p>Now you can use that fill-in as another clue. There is no pivot between the two blanks, meaning that the two fill-ins agree in some way.
