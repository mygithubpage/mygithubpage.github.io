            <p>The answer to a primary purpose question should incorporate elements of the entire passage. Avoid answer choices that address limited sections of the passage. The Point: Sarnoff was responsible for introducing television to the public and establishing a dominant paradigm. This is foreshadowed when Sarnoff is called “the father of television.”</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Farnsworth’s influence on the development of the television itself is only mentioned in the first paragraph; Farnsworth’s role in developing programs is never mentioned.</li>
              <li>The impact of television is not discussed until the second paragraph. Although this paragraph debates whether or not Sarnoff’s influence was a positive one, it does not address the influence of television on popular culture.</li>
              <li>Vladimir Zworykin is only mentioned briefly in the first paragraph, so he is clearly not the primary subject of the passage. Furthermore, even though the passage mentions the initial public perception, it says nothing about the current public perception of Zworykin.</li>

          <h3>Passage B: Television’s Invention</h3>
          <p>In the early years of television, Vladimir Zworykin was considered the device’s inventor, at least publicly. His loudest champion was his boss David Sarnoff, the president of RCA and the “father of television,” as he was and is widely regarded. Modern historians agree that Philo Farnsworth, a self-educated prodigy who was the first to transmit live images, was television’s technical inventor. But Farnsworth’s contributions have gone relatively unnoticed, since it was Sarnoff, not Farnsworth, who put televisions into living rooms. More importantly, it was Sarnoff who successfully borrowed from the radio industry the paradigm of advertiser-funded programming, a paradigm still dominant today. In contrast, Farnsworth lacked business savvy and was unable to realize his dream of television as an educational tool.</p>
          <p>Perhaps Sarnoff simply adapted his business ideas from other industries such as newspapers, replacing the revenue from subscriptions and newsstand purchases with that of television set sales, but Sarnoff promoted himself as a visionary. Some critics argue that Sarnoff’s construct has damaged programming content. Others contend that it merely created a democratic platform allowing audiences to choose the programming they desire.</p>

            <p>a number of critics feel that Sarnoff’s initial decision to earn television revenue through advertising has had a positive or neutral impact on content</p>
            <p>educational programs that are aired in prime time, the hours during which the greatest number of viewers are watching television, are less likely to earn a profit than those that are aired during the daytime hours</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>The second paragraph states that some critics viewed Sarnoff’s approach negatively and others thought his approach embodied a democratic concept. The correct answer must follow from at least one of those statements.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>You have been given no information about the television programs Sarnoff and Zworykin produced; in fact, you have not been told that they produced television shows. The paragraph is about the advertising revenue construct Sarnoff implemented, not about the television shows he produced.</li>
              <li>It is implied that ratings for educational programs are, in general, not strong, but that does not mean that any one particular educational program cannot have higher ratings than one particular sports program. Beware of answer choices that contain absolutes such as <i>cannot</i></li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> You are told that “some critics argue that Sarnoff’s paradigm has damaged programming content.” Since the word is <i>some</i>, it must be true that others feel it has played either a positive role or a neutral role. A group of these critics is mentioned in the last sentence of the paragraph.</li>
              <li>The passage does not differentiate programming based on what time television shows air, nor does it mention profitability.</li>
              <li>The word “should” implies a moral judgment, and the answer is therefore out of the scope of the passage. The second paragraph does not indicate a belief as to who should influence programming choices.</li>

            <p>In an attempt to trick you on a Specific question such as this, the GRE will offer incomplete answers that incorporate language from throughout the passage but do not directly bear on the question at hand. Two sections in the passage discuss ways in which the television industry brought in revenue. The first paragraph mentions “advertiser-funded programming.” The second paragraph states that Sarnoff borrowed from other business models by “replacing the revenue from subscriptions and newsstand purchases with that of television set sales.”</p>

            <p>This is a Select-in-Passage question relating to Sarnoff’s legacy as an imitator versus his legacy as an innovator. There are two plausible candidates. First, the second-to-last sentence of the first paragraph says that Sarnoff “successfully borrowed from the radio industry the paradigm of advertiser-funded programming.” This sentence states a fact indicating that Sarnoff took a business model from another medium, which would be imitative rather than innovative.</p>
            <p>The second possible answer is the first sentence of the second paragraph, which says: “Perhaps Sarnoff simply adapted his business ideas from other industries such as newspapers.” However, the use of the word <i>perhaps</i> means that this is an idea of the author’s, rather than a statement of fact. For this reason, this cannot be the answer.</p>
            <p>The correct answer is the second-to-last sentence of the first paragraph.</p>

              <li>While the last sentence says that some critics “argue that Sarnoff’s construct has damaged programming content,” this is not stated as a fact, only a possible opinion. Always be careful to differentiate between opinions and facts on RC passages.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> The first paragraph indicates that Farnsworth was the technical inventor of television. That paragraph also says that “Farnsworth’s contributions have gone relatively unnoticed, since it was Sarnoff who put televisions into living rooms.”</li>
              <li>Though the passage describes the ways in which both Zworykin and Farnsworth have been described as the progenitors of television, and though it makes a case that there remains a lively debate over who deserves the credit, this does not mean that there is “no way” of determining who invented the first television.

          <h3>Passage G: Chaos Theory</h3>
          <p>Around 1960, mathematician Edward Lorenz found unexpected behavior in apparently simple equations representing atmospheric air flows. Whenever he reran his model with the same inputs, different outputs resulted—although the model lacked any random elements. Lorenz realized that tiny rounding errors in his analog computer mushroomed over time, leading to erratic results. His findings marked a seminal moment in the development of chaos theory, which, despite its name, has little to do with randomness. </p>
          <p>To understand how unpredictability can arise from deterministic equations, which do not involve chance outcomes, consider the non-chaotic system of two poppy seeds placed in a round bowl. As the seeds roll to the bowl’s center, a position known as a point attractor, the distance between the seeds shrinks. If, instead, the bowl is flipped over, two seeds placed on top will roll away from each other. Such a system, while still not technically chaotic, enlarges initial differences in position. </p>
          <p>Chaotic systems, such as a machine mixing bread dough, are characterized by both attraction and repulsion. As the dough is stretched, folded, and pressed back together, any poppy seeds sprinkled in are intermixed seemingly at random. But this randomness is illusory. In fact, the poppy seeds are captured by “strange attractors,” staggeringly complex pathways whose tangles appear accidental but are in fact determined by the system’s fundamental equations. </p>
          <p>During the dough-kneading process, two poppy seeds positioned next to each other eventually go their separate ways. Any early divergence or measurement error is repeatedly amplified by the mixing until the position of any seed becomes effectively unpredictable. It is this “sensitive dependence on initial conditions” and not true randomness that generates unpredictability in chaotic systems, of which one example may be the Earth’s weather. According to the popular interpretation of the “Butterfly Effect,” a butterfly flapping its wings causes hurricanes. A better understanding is that the butterfly causes uncertainty about the precise state of the air. This microscopic uncertainty grows until it encompasses even hurricanes. Few meteorologists believe that we will ever be able to predict rain or shine for a particular day years in the future.</p>

              <li>The stickers on the balloon separate and come together repeatedly. This behavior meets the criterion of “both attraction and repulsion.” However, there is no mixing, and as a result, the system cannot be said to be analogous to a machine mixing dough.</li>

            <p>This is a Select-One-or-More question of a very specific variety. It is mostly relevant to the last paragraph of the passage, so you should make sure you have a solid understanding of the few sentences devoted to weather systems.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> Lorenz’s rounding errors are actually found in the first paragraph, where you read that “Lorenz realized that tiny rounding errors … mushroomed over time.” Similarly, in the final paragraph, you read: “this microscopic uncertainty grows until it encompasses even hurricanes.” These are both examples of chaotic systems.</li>
              <li>The last sentence of the passage says: “few metereologists believe that we will ever be able to predict rain or shine for a particular day years in the future.” The sentence does not indicate that meteorologists are unanimous; in fact, “few meteorologists” indicates that at least one actually believes that such predictions might be able to be made in the future.</li>
              <li>While you are told that the wings of a butterly can affect weather systems, you are never told that this is the most important contributing factor. Likely, major climatic events are more important than seemingly trivial events, such as a butterfly taking flight.</li>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="">
            <p><i>Misnomer</i> means that something has been given an incorrect or misleading name. You learned in the first paragraph that chaos theory, despite its name, “has little to do with randomness.” So you want to find a sentence in the second or third paragraph that illustrates this point.</p>
            <p>The final sentence of the third paragraph uses poppy seeds to show that even the bread-mixing machine, which appears to be mixing things at random (in a “chaotic” manner), is actually moving the seeds through “staggeringly complex pathways whose tangles appear accidental but are in fact determined by the system’s fundamental equations.” In other words, there’s nothing chaotic at all, only a very complex organization. This is a perfect example of why “chaos theory” is a kind of misnomer.</p>
            <p>Note that the second-to-last sentence of the third paragraph, “But this randomness is illusory,” does indicate that chaos theory might be called a misnomer. This sentence, though, does not illustrate <i>why</i> this is so.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b>
            </p>
            <p>The boldface font indicates that this is an Analyze the Argument question. Note that the question stem references the “media critic’s argument”—this is the conclusion you want.</p>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b>
            </p>
            <p>The first three sentences describe the network executives’ argument: alternate viewing platforms will cause fewer people to watch TV, resulting in lower advertising revenues. The networks then won’t have enough money to continue producing high-quality programming, so everyone will lose, even the people who are watching on alternate viewing platforms.</p>
            <p>The fourth sentence begins with the word “However.” The argument goes on to indicate that technology executives have research that contradicts the network executives’ view. The media critic then concludes that the networks can actually <i>increase</i> their advertising revenues.</p>
            <p>The first boldface portion opposes this position by predicting smaller audiences; label it W. The second boldface lends support to the critic’s conclusion by citing evidence that alternate media platforms lead their users to watch more television; label this one S.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: State the Goal</b>
            </p>
            <p>The correct answer will first describe a W and then a S.</p>
            <p><b>Step 4: Work from Wrong to Right</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li> The first boldface statement does weigh against the critic’s claim, but it is a prediction, rather than an inevitable trend. The second boldface statement is a premise supporting the claim; it is not the conclusion itself. </li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> The critic’s conclusion about a potential increase in network revenue is contrary to the first boldface statement’s prediction about shrinking audiences and falling revenue. Also, the critic’s argument does depend upon the second boldface statement’s assertion that users of alternate devices will actually watch more hours of television. </li>
              <li> The first boldface statement opposes the critic’s claim, rather than clarifies it. The second boldface statement is used to support the critic’s claim; it does not indicate that the critic’s claim is flawed. </li>
              <li> The argument does not indicate whether the technology executives accept or deny the prediction of the network executives. (Given, though, that the technology executives think that people will watch more television, not less, it doesn’t seem likely that the technology executives will agree with the network executives.) The second boldface statement contradicts the first one; it does not follow as a consequence. </li>
              <li> The first boldface statement offers a prediction, not an analogy. The second boldface statement is in agreement with, not in opposition to, the critic’s claim. </li>

          <p>Media Critic: Network executives have alleged that television viewership is decreasing due to the availability of television programs on other platforms, such as the internet, video-on-demand, and mobile devices. These executives claim that <b>declining viewership will cause advertising revenue to fall so far that networks will be unable to spend the large sums necessary to produce programs of the quality now available</b>. That development, in turn, will lead to a dearth of programming for the very devices that cannibalized television’s audience. However, technology executives point to research that indicates that <b>users of these platforms increase the number of hours per week that they watch television</b> because they are exposed to new programs and promotional spots through these alternate platforms. This analysis demonstrates that networks can actually increase their revenue through higher advertising rates, due to larger audiences lured to television through other media.</p>

Moving on to the first blank—a good fill-in might be “brought down.” The only answer that is a match is <i>humbled</i><i>Exalted</i> (held in high regard; in a state of extreme happiness) is the opposite of what the blank requires, and <i>unaffected</i> is too neutral to explain the change in how the entrepreneur is seen by others.</p>

            <p><b>Disdain, discipline, divesting.</b>The semicolon in this sentence indicates that the two parts of the sentence agree—the first part should mirror the meaning that “the brightest students … pursuing teaching” would be a good thing. For the first and second blanks, universities should therefore not <i>put down</i> education as an academic <i>area</i> or <i>pursuit</i> Don’t fall for trap answers; <i>proscribe</i> (ban) and <i>circumvent</i> (avoid via circuitous means) add extra meaning to the idea of <i>put down</i> Only <i>disdain</i> fits the first blank. <i>Discipline</i> is the closest match for the second blank (<i>tome</i> means “book, especially a large, academic book”). The third blank needs something that explains the “disservice” done to future students, namely, something like <i>depriving</i> them of the chance to learn from the best. The best choice is the synonym <i>divesting</i>; don’t fall for the traps of<i> denigrating </i>(defaming, belittling) and <i>degenerating</i> (deteriorating, declining). Both trap choices work with the theme, but don’t fit into the blank.</p>
