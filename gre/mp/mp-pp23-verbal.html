            <p>133. <b>An ironclad.</b> Since the final part of the sentence is meant to go against the idea that the Second Amendment provides a guarantee of a private right, you need to fill the blank in the first part with something that reinforces the guarantee. “Ironclad” means rigid or fixed and does what you need here. “Defeasible” and “questionable” would undermine the guarantee. Nothing in the passage has any bearing on whether the guarantee is “earnest.” “Amended” is a theme trap because the sentence is talking about the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, but “amended” means added to and does not fit the desired meaning for the blank.</p>

            <p>134. <b>Sophistry.</b> The sentence indicates that Lillian Hellman was being honest when calling her disingenuous, or deceitful, argumentative strategy “the nobility racket.” The fact that she calls the deceitful strategy a “racket” indicates that she doesn’t truly believe in the things she states while using this argumentative strategy. Therefore, the word that best fills the blank is “sophistry,” which means the use of fallacious arguments, often with the intent to deceive others. If someone espoused a “philosophy,” she would actually believe in what she was saying. “Sinecure” (a position that requires little work but provides financial benefit), “volubility” (talkativeness), and “serendipity” (fortunate accident) do not fit the desired meaning.</p>

These actions would do something like “corrupt” or “do bad things to” his integrity. The correct answer, “undermined,” means to reduce the power of, undercut, or sabotage. He’s not making fun of himself, so “ridiculed” doesn’t quite work. “Restored” is the opposite of the intended meaning. “Redacted” means to draft or make ready for publication.

This could be upsetting, dangerous, or some other negative word. Of the given options, “disquieting” (disturbing) fits. “Exhilarating” (exciting) is positive and “demeaning” (belittling or disdainful), while negative, does not match the meaning of the sentence. The situation is disturbing because someone could become a victim, or “casualty,” of an old war. It wouldn’t be disturbing to become a “hero” and “martyr” (someone who suffers or is killed for a cause) doesn’t fit the intended meaning of an accidental death.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="BDH">
            <p>137. <b>Dauntless, trepidation, peril.</b> The first part of the sentence says that even “perennially,” or enduringly, _________ reporters have had misgivings about entering a war zone. Since war zones are dangerous, the first blank is likely filled by a word that describes people who don’t usually worry about danger. “Dauntless” and “professional” could both fit; “foreign” does not. The part after the semicolon says that “their [the reporters] _________ at the prospect” of entering a war zone must be a reflection of the _________ that “pervades,” or spreads through, a war zone. People in a war zone are in danger and likely scared, not necessarily “professional,” so the first blank must mean not scared, or “dauntless,” the second blank must mean fear, and the third blank must mean fear or danger. The correct answer for the second blank, “trepidation” or sense of fear, fits perfectly. “Excitement” and “skepticism” don’t mean fear. The correct answer for the third blank, “peril,” means danger and so also fits perfectly. Although “awareness” is tempting because “heightened awareness” is often associated with dangerous situations, the meaning is wrong because fear is not “a reflection of the heightened awareness”; rather, “heightened awareness” is a result of fear. “Rhetoric,” or persuasive speaking, is a great GRE word, but has the wrong meaning for the third blank.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="CFH">
            <p>138. <b>Practiced restraint, asceticism, permissive.</b> The word “however” in the second sentence indicates that Jean—who “exercises a self-discipline”—is very different from most teenagers. Therefore, teenagers are not associated with self-discipline. For blank (i), the phrase that most closely matches is “practiced restraint.” “Silent obedience” doesn’t quite match and “urbanity” means polite, confident, or polished. For blank (ii), the idiom “verges on” indicates that the word will mean some extreme form of self-discipline. The best word for that is “asceticism” (a lifestyle of extreme self-denial). “Asperity” (harshness in tone or temper) is tempting but usually refers more to emotions or weather conditions. For blank (iii), the words “whether” and “or” indicate that the blank will describe the opposite of a “conservative upbringing.” The best match is “permissive.” Jean might want to react to a “meddlesome,” or very intrusive, upbringing, but it’s not the opposite of conservative. Don’t be tempted by “illiberal,” which means narrow-minded or bigoted.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="AE">
            <p>133. <b>Mistaken, untrue.</b> Prognosticators are people who predict the future, and, according to the sentence, listening to them is a “problem” because no one holds them accountable for their predictions today. This idea is echoed in the idiomatic phrase “for every X there are Y,” where X and Y contrast. So, for every “accurate prediction” there are “several others” that are <i>not</i> accurate. “Mistaken” and “untrue” fit this definition. A false or inaccurate prediction might be unintentionally “misleading,” but describing a statement as “misleading” typically implies lack of clarity or deliberate deception; this goes too far, and “mistaken” and “untrue” pair better with each other than either does with “misleading.” Both “unforeseen” and “surprising” mean unexpected, so these form an answer pair. However, the context is wrong: an inaccurate prediction might make the ultimate outcome unexpected, but this blank describes the other predictions themselves. A hurried, or “hasty,” prediction might or might not turn out to be inaccurate, but there are no indications of prediction speed in the sentence.</p>

            <p>134. <b>Culpable, complicit.</b> “Allegations” are unproven claims that someone has done something wrong or illegal, so if they “turn out to be true,” the administrators would be found to be guilty or deserving of blame. This is further supported by the negative results: “the university may lose its accreditation” and the perpetrators “might never be able to be employed in higher education again.” The answers “culpable” (deserving blame) and “complicit” (collaborating with others in an illegal activity or wrongdoing) both fit the meaning of the sentence and produce sentences that are alike in meaning. “Repentant” and “contrite” are an answer pair meaning remorseful or guilt-ridden, which is close, but goes a bit too far: the sentence indicates they may be “found” guilty but not necessarily that they feel badly about it. The remaining choices are unpaired and not a good fit for the blank anyway. “Synoptic,” which is related to the word “synopsis,” means forming a summary.

If even his “adherents,” his devoted followers or admirers, could not take this claim seriously, then this claim must be too far-fetched to believe. “Immoderate” (exceeding reasonable limits) and “extreme” both fit this meaning well. “Temperate” and “lax” would both indicate the opposite—a relaxed or balanced position.

To “sheathe” a weapon is to put it away (in a sheath, which is a cover for a blade); this is the opposite of using it in a “display of force.” Ideas or information can be “promulgated” or “disseminated,” meaning spread, communicated, or publicized, so these choices form an answer pair. However, swords cannot be “promulgated” or “disseminated,” so the answer pair doesn’t work in this context. To “cauterize” is to burn skin or flesh to stop bleeding or seal a wound, so this choice is unpaired and does not match the required meaning.

          <p>For many years, most physicists supported one of two cosmological theories: thesteady-state universe, and the Big Bang. The theory of the steady-state universe states that theuniverse has always existed exactly as we observe it at present, whereas the Big Bang theorypostulates that the universe was conceived from a singularity in space-time that has expanded into the current universe. The validity of either theory was not tested until 1929, when EdwinHubble famously discovered what is now known as Hubble’s Law. this relation and over years of observation, Hubble calculated the distance to many of thesevariable stars. Milton Humason, a fellow astronomer, helped Hubble to calculate the stars’relative velocities to Earth. When Hubble combined the two data sets he found an interestingrelationship: all the stars appeared to be moving away from us! In fact, the speed at which theywere moving increased with an increasing distance from Earth. Hubble realized, from this small set of data, that the earth was a part of the expandinguniverse. As the universe expands outward in all directions, any observer from a fixed vantagepoint will look out and see everything running away from them. The further away any twopoints are, the more the expansion affects them, and the faster they appear to be movingaway from each other. Hubble’s result was the first experimental proof that we do not live in a steady-state universe, but rather a dynamic and expanding one.</p>

            <p>156. <b>1st and 2nd only.</b> The last sentence states that Hubble’s experiment was “proof that we do not live in a steady-state universe, but rather a dynamic and expanding one”; therefore it must be true that the steady-state universe theory does not allow for an expanding universe. The first statement can be inferred. The second paragraph also notes that the speed at which objects are moving away from each other in space increases with an increasing distance between the objects. Thus, the second statement can be properly inferred. Finally, the third statement incorrectly assumes that once the steady-state universe theory was disproved, the Big Bang was the only theory that remained. The first sentence of the passage states only that “most physicists supported one of two cosmological theories,” leaving the possibility of other theories that might still agree with Hubble’s discovery.</p>

Thus, (A) is the correct choice. On the other hand, if the agendas of the gods coincided with the demands of fate, that wouldn’t support the idea that the gods were in charge of fate, so choice (B) would not support the assumption. If Homer and Heradotus disagreed about the motives and agendas of the gods, as choice (C) claims, that would not undermine the view that for both authors fate is beyond the gods.

          <p>Homer’s <i>The Odyssey</i> is an epic poem that put a popular oral myth into writing forthe first time. <i>The Histories</i> is an attempt by its author Herodotus to provide an unbiasedaccount of historical conflicts in the Hellenistic world. These two works share two importantmotifs: the interference of the gods in the events of the mortal world, and the concept of a predetermined and unavoidable destiny. One might assume that these two themes are oneand the same—a predetermined fate set forth by the gods. However, Homer’s and Herodotus’sgods are presented as acting in a political fashion—each one acting within certain boundariesto accomplish his or her own agenda. As such, the wills of the gods do not coincide to allowfor the formulation of a cohesive “master plan.” Instead of destiny created by the gods, Homer and Herodotus present fate as something beyond the gods—a driving force under which theactions of gods and mortals lead to the realization of destiny. In <i>The Odyssey</i> and <i>The Histories</i>,the idea of gods with limited power leads to a conception of fate wherein the gods act not asthe creators of destiny, but as agents of its fulfillment.</p>

          <p>The goal of a sunscreen chemical is simple—to prevent harmful UVB (and in some casesUVA) radiation from penetrating the skin. There are two main ways in which this goal can beaccomplished—by reflecting (physically blocking) ultraviolet light or by absorbing UV light.Sunscreen chemicals are therefore put into two groups based on which method they employ; they are classified as either <i>physical blockers</i> or <i>chemical absorbers</i>. Physical blockers, the mostcommon of which is titanium dioxide, scatter all radiation in the UVB and UVA range. Titaniumdioxide reflects light waves in the 290–770 nm range. However, the vast majority of commercialsunscreens are chemical absorbers. They absorb photons of light of specific wavelengths and use the energy to promote electronsbetween energy levels. When the electrons later return to the ground energy state, theyemit light at longer wavelengths (lower energies). Chemical species that exhibit this behaviorare called chromophores. The specific wavelength absorbed by a given chromophore isdetermined by the discrete quantal amounts of energy that are required to excite electrons between the energy levels or its molecules. Since the primary objective of an absorbingsunscreen is to absorb UVB light (290–320 nm), the best sunscreens are those that absorb mostheavily in this range. The chromophores that most readily fit this requirement are those withconjugated pi-bonding systems.</p>

Choice (C) would be correct if not for the range given: the author does not indicate how chromophores react to light above 320 nm. Choice (B) is the exact opposite of what the question asks for.
