            <p>61. <b>Elaboration, expatiation.</b> “Eschew” means to avoid or abstain, thus the speaker was unable to resist something that lengthened her presentation. The correct answer, “elaboration,” would lengthen a presentation. “Terseness” means brevity and is a reversal trap, and “precision” also is generally not something that would cause a presentation to become excessively long. For the second blank, the clue is “turned a five-minute policy brief into an hour-long,” making “expatiation,” which means to speak or write at length, the correct choice. Since the second blank must match the general meaning of the first blank, “elaboration,” the answer for the first blank provides another clue. “Distension,” the act of swelling, refers only to a physical swelling. Similarly, “repertory,” a collection of information or examples, doesn’t fit the context either.</p>

            <p>62. <b>Cosmopolitan.</b> Because the clue is “no effect,” the blank will oppose championing “economic, political, and even cultural isolationism.” Isolationism is a policy of abstaining from relationships with other countries, so the senator’s upbringing must have been non-isolationist, or worldly. “Cosmopolitan” means worldly and is therefore a good fit. “Opulent” (wealthy), “tendentious” (opinionated), and “liberal” are all theme traps that ignore the contrast between the senator’s upbringing and his views. “Bucolic” refers to an idyllic rural life and does not match the sentence.</p>

            <p>63. <b>Protean, quixotic.</b> The first blank needs an idea that contrasts with “concrete proposal.” “Protean” matches nicely. “Oppositional” and “martial” (warlike) don’t contrast with “concrete” and so aren’t correct. For the second blank, you need a word that also represents the idea of not being “concrete,” as well as the idea of being “unlikely to ever come to fruition.” “Quixotic” matches perfectly. “Pragmatic” is the exact opposite, and the sentence does not indicate whether the idea is “unorthodox” (against tradition).</p>

            <p>64. <b>An arcadian, hinterland, spartan.</b> A “refuge” is positive; you also have the clue “quiet and rural.” “Arcadian” conveys a positive view of rural life. “Parochial” (provincial) has a similar meaning except that it is somewhat negative. “Squalid” (dirty and run down) is even worse. The clue for the second blank is the word “but,” which indicates that the “well-heeled” (wealthy) visitors see the region very differently; the sentence requires a negative version of the first blank. “Hinterland” conveys the idea of a backwater or an undesirable place. Neither “asylum” (place of refuge) nor “utopia” (a perfect place) have the required negative spin. The wealthy visitors see life there as “unpleasantly _________,” so a negative word is needed. The only choice that can be negative is “spartan” (simple, austere.) “Tony” (posh, stylish) and “rational” are both positive.</p>

            <p>65. <b>Debauchery, licentious.</b> This sentence features a somewhat complex structure. “Though” indicates that both blanks will oppose “prudish,” since her stories are very different than her life. “Debauchery” (referring to sexual excess) fits the first blank, and “licentious” (lewd or sexually unrestrained) fits the second blank. “Propriety” (proper behavior) and “moralizing” are reversal traps, as they are aligned with prudishness. “Dissent” and “perspicacious” (perceptive) do not match the meaning or structure.</p>

            <p>66. <b>Regressive, an auxiliary.</b> Given the lengthy explanation of the club’s history, the elderly male member’s suggestion was backwards, or hopelessly old-fashioned. Only “regressive” matches. “Rustic” (rural) and “prudish” (excessively proper or modest) both add something to the description of the old man that is not in the original sentence. In the second blank, you want something that reflects the idea “play bridge and drink tea without having to worry about serious issues.” “Auxiliary” has this sense of secondary or on the side. The word “incendiary” (flammable) is almost an opposite of the desired meeting. Although the proposed organization might be “hierarchical,” there is nothing in the sentence that suggests that.</p>

            <p>61. <b>Contrite, penitential.</b> Criminal defendants want to look good in front of the judge by “showing that not all moral sympathy is lost on them.” The defendants are not necessarily innocent, so “vindicated” doesn’t work. Neither would “pious,” meaning devoutly religious, or “messianic,” meaning fervent or passionate. And “callous” has the opposite tone of the intended meaning; a defendant appearing callous in front of a judge would be showing insensitivity for his or her actions. That leaves the correct answers, “contrite” and “penitential,” both of which mean remorseful or apologetic.</p>

            <p>62. <b>Phlegmatic, unflappable.</b> The surgeon worked “methodically” and addressed paramedics “evenly,” so his reactions in an emergency would be calm, cool, and in control. “Phlegmatic” means not excitable, calm, and composed, so it’s a good fit. “Unflappable” means not easily upset or perturbed, especially in a crisis. “Qualified” is a bit of a trap: he’s a qualified doctor, but to say that his reactions were “qualified” would imply that they were limited or restricted in some way. Someone methodical might be “premeditat[ing]” about certain things, but how can a reaction be “premeditated”? He couldn’t pre-plan his response to an emergency. “Enraptured” and “enthusiastic” would indicate emotional responses, but, in fact, the opposite was true: he showed little emotion and retained composure.</p>

            <p>63. <b>Skeptical, leery.</b> The word “Despite” at the beginning of the sentence indicates that the blank must oppose the encouragement of a con artist (someone who tricks people out of money)—that is, the “mark” is doubtful about the con artist’s claims. (A mark is someone who is a target of a criminal or con artist.) “Skeptical” and “leery” match this meaning. “Optimistic” and “enthused” create a pair, but do not fit the required meaning of the sentence. And the remaining words neither fit the intended meaning of the sentence nor form a pair: “irascible” means easily angered, while “jaundiced” most commonly means yellow in complexion (from the medical condition) but can also mean bitter or envious.</p>

            <p>64. <b>Stemming from, engendered by.</b> If the editorialist is “on the board of the agency’s primary competitor,” then any attack on the ad campaign was probably written with ulterior motives. The blank should mean something like “coming from.” “Stemming from” and “engendered by” would both fit this meaning (“engendered” means created or produced). “Producing” and “creating” are a trap here; they would suggest that the editorial itself <i>created</i> the adversarial motives, which isn’t the case. The fact that the writer was on the board suggests that the adversarial motives led to the editorial, not vice versa. “Typifying” and “epitomized by” both suggest “being the ideal example of.” The sentence doesn’t suggest that the editorial is the <i>perfect</i> example of adversarial motives; it just implies that the piece was spawned by them.</p>

BecauseNeanderthals and modern humans are known to have diverged hundreds of thousandsof years before modern humans left Africa, Paabo attributed any such common DNA tointerbreeding in Eurasia. Paabo’s team announced that the modern humans from China,France, and Papua New Guinea all have the same proportion of Neanderthal DNA, and inferred that interbreeding with Neanderthals must have taken place before the ancestor populationof those Eurasians divided. Paabo maintained that these two events, the migration of modernhumans out of Africa and the division of the Eurasian population, mark the interval duringwhich the interbreeding must have taken place, and that for roughly forty thousand years ofthat window, Neanderthals and modern humans lived near one another in the Middle East. The team’s conclusions were answered with skepticism on a number of fronts. Criticspointed out that an earlier report reached similar conclusions based on Neanderthal sampleslater found to be contaminated with DNA from modern humans. Paleontologists andarchaeologists charged that the conclusion was unsupported by archaeological evidence.Further, Paabo’s team found evidence only of Neanderthal DNA in modern humans, not of modern human DNA in Neanderthals, but critics claim that interbreeding would result in geneflow in both directions.</p>

The first statement is wrong because there is no suggestion that the contamination of Neanderthal DNA with modern human DNA was deliberate, nor even that it was done by Paabo, nor is any other reason offered to doubt his integrity. The second statement is wrong because there is no suggestion that they ignore DNA evidence, even if they are not as persuaded by it as Paabo and his team.</p>

You can use that information to eliminate (A) and (B). The passage also claims that multiple reflecting surfaces are apt to produce a reverberation rather than an echo, so cross off (C).

          <p>Though an echo is a fairly simple acoustic phenomenon—a reflection of sound wavesoff some hard surface—it occurs only under very specific circumstances. Imagine a listenerstanding at the sound source. The reflecting object must be more than 11.3 meters awayfrom the sound source, or the echo will return too soon to be distinguishable from the original sound. A reflecting object more than about 170 meters, on the other hand, will rarelyproduce an audible echo, since sound dissipates with distance. Further, multiple surfaces eachreflecting the same original sound to the same listener will likely not produce an echo, but areverberation, a persistent sound gradually decreasing in amplitude until the listener can nolonger hear it. Common though echoes are then, it is unsurprising that some sounds seem to produce no echo. sound of the duck quacking in the anechoic chamber was clearly different from the sound ofthe duck quacking in the echo chamber, but the researchers acknowledged that it would bevery hard to recognize an echo in the latter recording without having very recently heard theformer. Partly this is because a quack isn’t a single burst of sound, but fades in and out, so thatthe beginning of the echo might blend with the end of the original sound. Partly it is because a quack is just not very loud. The Salford researchers also speculate that most people maysimply not encounter ducks in proximity to reflectors such as buildings or mountains. A furthercomplication, though one the researchers leave unremarked, is that people generally hearducks in flocks, where one quack might be indistinguishable from the echo of another.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>27. <b>(E).</b> The passage provides some specific information about the effects of calorie restriction. In rats and mice, this diet is known to prolong life by preventing diseases. In a study of moderately overweight humans, insulin levels and body temperature decreased. A proper GRE inference must follow from the specific information provided, without relying on any significant assumptions.</p>
            <p>(A) The passage states that calorie restriction in mice and rats prolongs life by preventing diseases. The human study had much more limited findings—that calorie restriction in moderately overweight humans decreases insulin levels and body temperature. While these traits are known to be associated with longevity, there is no data that links calorie restriction itself to prolonged human life. Additionally, calorie restriction may have other unstated effects, unrelated to longevity. There is no information in the passage that indicates whether these effects are the same in humans as in mice and rats. Finally, the use of the term “humans” is far too general; the study dealt only with moderately overweight humans and so any inference would need to be restricted to this subset of individuals.</p>
            <p>(B) While the passage indicates that certain traits known to be associated with longevity are found in moderately overweight humans who reduce their calorie intake, this is far removed from the conclusion that calorie intake will actually increase a human’s lifespan. Additionally, as with answer choice (A), the use of the term “humans” is far too general.</p>
            <p>(C) The study observed that individuals with the greatest percentage decrease in their calorie intake demonstrated the greatest decrease in insulin levels and body temperature. This shows a strong correlation between calorie intake and insulin levels. However, this correlation is not necessarily direct. It is possible that this correlation holds, but only up to a point. For example, it might be the case that any reduction in calorie intake over 50% does not result in any additional insulin level decreases. Moreover, the passage only draws this correlation for individuals with the greatest percent decrease in calorie intake. It is very possible that individuals with a relatively low decrease in calorie intake exhibit the exact same decrease in insulin levels as individuals with a moderate decrease in calorie intake.</p>
            <p>(D) The study makes no reference to the health of individuals who reduce their calorie intake. It tries to draw some connection to the longevity of those individuals, but longevity is not the same as health. An individual could live a very long, unhealthy life.</p>
            <p><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> The passage states that the greatest decrease in insulin levels was observed in individuals with the greatest percentage change in their calorie intake. This means that some individuals in the study reduced their calorie intake by a greater percentage than other individuals in the study. The passage also states that the study participants reduced their individual calorie intakes by “at least 25%.” Thus, one can safely infer that there were some participants who reduced their calorie intake by more than 25%.</p>

          <p> Calorie restriction, a diet high in nutrients but low in calories, is known to prolong the life of rats and mice by preventing heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other diseases. A 6-month study of 48 moderately overweight people, who each reduced their calorie intake by at least 25%, demonstrated decreases in insulin levels and body temperature, with the greatest decrease observed in individuals with the greatest percentage change in their calorie intake. Low insulin level and body temperature are both considered signs of longevity, partly because an earlier study by other researchers found both traits in long-lived people.</p>

            <p>(A) The research compared married people to unmarried people. Neither the researchers nor the media commentators made any distinction between newlyweds and those who had been married a long time, so this assumption is not necessary.</p>

            <p>(C) At first, this statement may seem necessary—after all, if the commentators conclude that marriage causes happiness, a lack of depression in married people would certainly support that conclusion.
