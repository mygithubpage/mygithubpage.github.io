The second word should suggest a type of training, and among the options only “apprenticeship” does so. “Acumen” (sharp insight) and “sensibility” are not types of training.</p>

            <p>128. <b>Arresting, charismatic.</b> The first singer is good “but” she is not as good as the next singer; the first blank requires a positive word. Only “arresting” (impressive) fits. Both “unremarkable” and “hackneyed” (trite or unoriginal) are negative. If the first singer is not as good, then the second singer is better, so the latter’s stage presence must be much better. “Pedestrian” (unremarkable) doesn’t fit, but both “charismatic” and “experienced” are fairly positive words. Here, there are two ways to eliminate “experienced.” First, while you might call the singer herself “experienced,” the target of this blank is the singer’s “stage presence,” which cannot be properly described as “experienced.” Second, “arresting,” the correct choice for blank (i), aligns very well with a “charismatic” stage presence.</p>

            <p>129. <b>Confounding, acumen.</b> The “contradictions in the philosopher’s life were more _________” given that the philosopher had some characteristic that led to “profound insights,” meaning a very deep understanding or awareness. Since the second blank is that characteristic, start there. Although “prodigal” is often used to mean extravagant, here it means something more like abundant. The second blank must mean something like skill then, because a high level of intellectual skill would logically lead to deep understanding, and the first blank must mean surprising, because it would be surprising if someone who was very skilled at making good judgments had a lot of contradictions in his life. The correct answer to the first blank is “confounding,” which means surprising. “Insightful” and “unpremeditated” are words associated with thought, but they do not fit the desired meaning for the first blank. The correct answer for the second blank, “acumen,” is the skill of making good judgements. “Vacuity,” which means empty-headedness, is the exact opposite of what is needed. “Veracity” means truthfulness, which is tempting, but doesn’t quite fit with the clue. A truthful person is not necessarily going to have deep insights.</p>

            <p>130. <b>Eminence, influence.</b> Borrowing another word from the sentence, the first word should be something like “significance.” The closest option is “eminence,” which suggests great importance. If Hopper argues that the book was among the most important in spite of the fact that it cannot have had an impact on O’Brien’s contemporaries, then he must appeal to some standard other than impact. “Influence” is the word most nearly synonymous with impact. Because “currency” echoes the concern about how widely read the book was, it might appeal, but this word does not fit the earlier clue; he “appeals to standards other than” the one mentioned earlier, “impact on one’s contemporaries.” Finally, “dissolution” (dissolving or ending something) is not a type of standard.</p>

            <p>131. <b>Denigrate, balkanized.</b> Start with the second blank. A society with “class warfare” is divided into hostile groups, or “balkanized,” but it need not be either “socialized” or “politicized.” Politicians who “refuse to accept” such talk would tend to dismiss or belittle, or “denigrate,” it. “Besmirch” means to attack the honor of something—although the word is negative, it isn’t quite appropriate here. “Encourage” is a reversal trap: since the sentence says that the politicians do not believe that society is experiencing “class warfare,” they would not urge people to discuss it.</p>

            <p>132. <b>Deftness, peasant, dissembled.</b> The subject “magically acquired an honorific title” and he was able to “parlay this charade into a small fortune.” These hints suggest that his motive was to make himself look and sound more important than he actually was. Blank (i) and blank (ii) contrast how he was able to get away with this trick: because of his “aquiline,” meaning regal, nose and his social tendencies, and despite his genetics. The best fit for blank (i) is “deftness,” which means skilled or clever. The other options here both suggest something negative about his social abilities, be it “arrogance,” meaning conceit, or “maladroitness,” meaning ineffective or clumsy, the opposite of the meaning needed here. Blank (ii) describes his “genetics, which lacked any distinction.” The best match is “peasant,” or a farm worker with little social status. “Perturbing” is too negative in this context. And “patrician,” which means characteristic of aristocracy, is the opposite of what the blank requires. Finally, blank (iii) calls for a word that indicates how he “successfully” was able to act in order “to parlay this charade into a small fortune.” Of the answer choices, “coalesced” means to combine distinct elements, which does not fit in this context. Likewise, “disseminated” means to spread or disperse something, and also doesn’t fit here. “Dissembled” (disguise or conceal) fits best: he successfully disguised his true identity.</p>

While the other options in this question could possibly describe a person’s opinion on political discourse, the only words that could match “hateful” are “virulence” and “acrimony,” both of which mean harsh or full of malice. “Partisanship” and “intransigence” form a pair, since each means biased or unlikely to compromise, but without anything in the sentence suggesting that people are not willing to compromise, the pair does not work here.

The sentence contains two important clues. First, he went through a “process of canonization” posthumously (after his death), meaning that he was turned into a saint-like figure in the popular imagination. Second, during the process, his “more palatable” (pleasing or easy to agree with) “and less far-reaching political and social visions became prominent.” It must be true, then, that he had less palatable, more far-reaching visions that are now overlooked. The word in the blank should mean something like revolutionary or boundary-pushing. “Radical” and “immoderate” both fit this meaning.

Finally, when down to “predictable,” “quotidian,” and “mundane,” choose the best pair. “Predictable” is a near miss here.

          <p>The cosmic microwave background is a uniform 2.7 Kelvin radiation that permeatesthe entire universe. Although it was postulated almost 50 years before, Penzias and Wilsondiscovered the cosmic microwave background accidentally in the 1970s. Working at Bell Labs,these two scientists were using a radio telescope to observe distant stars. They found, however, that no matter where they pointed their telescope they observed an approximately 3 Kelvinbackground signal. After convincing themselves that this signal was real and not some artifactof their instrument, they consulted with a team at Princeton University that had been searchingfor the cosmic microwave background. The Princeton team confirmed what Penzias andWilson had found. Apparently, Penzias and Wilson had accidentally stumbled upon the oldest observable relic of the early universe. the building blocks of ordinary matter. Photons, the smallest particles of light, also filled theuniverse and were so energetic that they “bounced” off electrons, keeping the electronsand protons from forming atoms. After approximately 400,000 more years, the photons lostenough energy that atoms could form readily. Without any lone electrons off of which photonscould “bounce,” the photons began streaming unimpeded all through the universe, mostly unchanged but for one exception. Due to the further expansion and cooling of the universe,these photons have cooled to just 2.7 degrees above absolute zero. It was these same photonsthat Penzias and Wilson observed approximately 13.6 billion years later here on Earth.</p>

            <p>149. <b>(D).</b> The passage states that Penzias and Wilson accidentally discovered the cosmic microwave background and did not even understand what they had found until after consulting the Princeton group. It can be inferred that they did not initially understand the implications of their result, matching choice (D). Choice (A) is incorrect as the passage does not describe the importance of the signal for which Penzias and Wilson were originally searching. Choice (B) is incorrect as the passage never discusses the Princeton instrumentation used for searching for the cosmic microwave background. The capabilities of the telescope used by Penzias and Wilson are never discussed, thus choice (C) is not supported. Finally, the opposite of choice (E) is stated in the passage, which says that Penzias and Wilson convinced themselves that their signal was real before approaching the Princeton team.</p>

The first statement is an example of one of the things Sousa was afraid of—vocal instruction being less a “normal part of education”—and thus does not “contradict.” The second statement is an example of the phonograph increasing amateur music playing and “domestic music,” so this does contradict Sousa’s point. Finally, the third statement is an example of recorded music being more sincere than live music, so this definitely contradicts Sousa’s point.</p>

          <p>American composer and conductor John Philip Sousa viewed the increasing popularityof the phonograph with deep dismay. He suggested that it would “reduce the expression ofmusic to a mathematical system of megaphones, wheels, cogs, disks, cylinders, and all mannerof revolving things, which are as like real art as the marble statue of Eve is like her beautiful, living, breathing daughters.” Such “mechanical” music was not sincere, according to Sousa:“The nightingale’s song is delightful because the nightingale herself gives it forth. The boy witha penny whistle and glass of water may give an excellent imitation, but let him persist, he issent to bed as a nuisance.” instrument purchases and predicting that when music comes so easily out of a phonograph,mothers will not bother to sing lullabies to their babies. He opined that when music is soreadily playable, musical and vocal instruction as a normal part of education will fall out offashion, the “tide of amateurism” receding, and music will become the province of machinesand professional singers only. “What of the national throat?” asked Sousa. “Will it not weaken?

            <p>153. <b>1st only.</b> The passage states in the first sentence that “an idealized blackbody is an object that reflects zero incident electromagnetic radiation.” Therefore, if an object reflects incident electromagnetic radiation, it cannot be an idealized blackbody and the first statement can be properly inferred. The second statement, however, cannot be inferred as the passage states that “a possible Doppler shift” can cause a fundamental change in the original spectral characteristics of reflected electromagnetic radiation. Finally, for the third statement, the passage states that any object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation is a perfect blackbody. However, the passage also states that “a microscopic ‘forest’ of vertically aligned single-wall carbon nanotubes of varying heights applied to a surface” is “the closest [that] scientists have come thus far to creating a perfectly dark material,” implying that this material is not a perfect blackbody.

          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)Some teachers believe that financial compensation is not the only factor contributing to job satisfaction and teaching performance.</p>

            <p>(C)Upon leaving the teaching profession, many young teachers cite a lack of opportunity for more rapid financial advancement as a primary factor in their decisions to change careers.</p>
            <p>(D)A merit-based system that bases compensation on teacher performance reduces collaboration, which is an integral component of quality instruction.</p>
            <p>(E)In school districts that have implemented pay-for-performance compensation structures, standardized test scores have dramatically increased.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>53. <b>(D).</b> The argument concerns the compensation system for public school teachers. It suggests that educational experts believe that a system of teacher compensation based on performance rather than seniority would help to retain exceptional teachers and maintain quality instruction. The correct answer is the one that most undermines this contention of the educational experts.</p>
            <p>(A) Irrelevant. That many factors contribute to job satisfaction and teaching performance neither weakens nor strengthens the argument for a performance-based pay structure for public school teachers.</p>
            <p>(B) Irrelevant. Nothing in the argument indicates that one universal system of compensation must be adopted. It is very possible that several effective models of performance-based pay could be developed and implemented successfully.</p>
            <p>(C) Strengthens. This choice indicates that many young teachers are extremely frustrated by the traditional pay structure in which financial advancement is directly tied to seniority. Thus, these teachers would likely welcome a change that allows them more rapid opportunity for financial advancement.</p>
            <p><b>(D) CORRECT.</b> Weakens. This choice indicates that collaboration among teachers is integral to high-quality instruction and that a system of compensation based on teacher performance reduces collaboration. Thus, the effect of a merit-based system of pay would be to undermine quality instruction, which is one of the two stated goals of the educational experts.</p>
            <p>(E) Strengthens. The educational experts’ argument in favor of performance-based compensation is bolstered if standardized tests scores have dramatically risen in school districts that have instituted such pay structures.</p>

            <p>(A) The first boldface does weigh against the argument, but it is a prediction, rather than “an inevitable trend”; the second boldface supports the argument but is not the conclusion itself.</p>
            <p><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> The argument about potential increased network revenue is contrary to the first boldface’s prediction about shrinking audiences and falling revenue; the argument indeed depends upon the second boldface’s assertion that users of alternative devices will actually watch more hours of television.</p>

          <p> Network executives have alleged that television viewership is decreasing due to the availability of television programs on other platforms, such as the internet, video-on-demand, and mobile devices. These executives claim that <b>declining viewership will cause advertising revenue to fall so far that networks will be unable to spend the large sums necessary to produce programs of the quality now available</b>. That development, in turn, will lead to a dearth of programming for the very devices that cannibalized television’s audience. However, technology executives point to research that indicates that <b>users of these devices increase the number of hours per week that they watch television</b> because they are exposed to new programs and promotional spots through these alternative platforms. This analysis demonstrates that networks can actually increase their revenue through higher advertising rates, due to larger audiences lured to television through other media.</p>
