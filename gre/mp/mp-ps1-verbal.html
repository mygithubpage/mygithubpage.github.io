            <p>To identify the primary purpose of the passage, examine the passage as a whole. Avoid answer choices that address only limited sections of the passage.

                <b>CORRECT.</b> The passage as a whole describes the immense value of the Japanese sword to both the samurai (the sword’s owner) and the smith (its maker). The saying “the sword is the soul of the samurai” is referenced early to indicate this importance. Later portions of the passage detail the tremendous effort that is put into each sword, reflecting the importance of each one.</li>

          <h3>Passage A: Japanese Swords</h3>
          <p>Historians have long recognized the traditional Japanese sword, or <i>nihonto</i>, as one of the finest cutting weapons ever produced, but it has even been considered a spiritual entity. The adage “the sword is the soul of the samurai” reflects the sword’s psychic importance, not only to its wielder, but also to its creator, the master smith. Not classically regarded as artists, master smiths nevertheless exerted great care in the process of creating swords, no two of which were ever forged exactly the same way. Over hundreds of hours, two types of steel were repeatedly heated, hammered, and folded together into thousands of imperceptible layers, yielding both a razor-sharp, durable edge and a flexible, shock-absorbing blade. Commonly, though optionally, the smith physically signed the blade; moreover, each smith’s secret forging techniques left an idiosyncratic structural signature. Each unique finished product reflected the smith’s personal honor and devotion to the craft, and today, the Japanese sword is valued as much for its artistic merit as for its historical significance.</p>

            <p>The Japanese sword is the most important handheld weapon in history.</p>

            <p>The Japanese sword has more historical importance than artistic importance.</p>

            <p>When looking for statements with which the author could agree, be sure to avoid extreme words and positions that go beyond the author’s statements in the passage. This question requires attention to both the general Point of the passage and specific details throughout.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The opening sentence says: “Historians have long recognized the traditional Japanese sword … as one of the finest cutting weapons ever produced”; however, there is no indication that the Japanese sword is the <i>most</i> important handheld weapon in history.</li>
              <li>This passage does not discuss the skill of the samurai warrior.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> According to the passage, every master smith had a “structural signature” due to his own secret forging process. Therefore, if a physical signature is present on a blade, that blade’s structural signature could then be associated with a master smith, whose <i>master</i> status implies the creation of numerous swords.</li>
              <li>The passage mentions that each sword “reflected the smith’s personal honor and devotion to craft”; however, there is no claim that master smiths emphasized their swords’ artistic merit at the expense of practical qualities.</li>
              <li>The final sentence indicates that the sword “is valued as much for it artistic merit as for its historical significance.” According to the passage, the two attributes are essentially equally valued; the Japanese sword is not more valued for the historical aspect.</li>

            <p>They refer to the unique curved shape of the blade.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>The author states that “each smith’s secret forging techniques left an idiosyncratic structural signature.” The words <i>idiosyncratic </i>and <i>signature</i> imply the uniqueness of the smith’s process. Be careful not to infer any additional information, particularly when the question refers to a specific sentence or phrase.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>In the passage, such an inscription is referred to as a “physical signature,” not a “structural signature.”</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT. </b>Note that the proof sentence indicates that each smith had his own process, and so the “structural signature” was unique to each smith (not necessarily to each individual blade).</li>
              <li>This statement seems reasonable. However, the passage does not say whether all master smiths are currently “known.” Certain swords with a “structural signature” may be of unknown origin.</li>
              <li>The second sentence mentions the saying “the sword is the soul of the samurai,” but you are not told that the “structural signature” was the aspect of the sword reflecting the soul of the samurai who wielded it. The second paragraph explains that the sword “reflected the <b>smith’s</b> personal honor and devotion to craft.” This statement, however, does not justify the claim that the structural signature itself reflects the soul of the samurai who wielded it.</li>

              <li>The words “historical significance” close the passage, but the description of the forging process fails to explain or outline that significance.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> The description of the forging process underscores the uniqueness of individual Japanese swords. One sentence mentions that “no two [swords] were ever forged in exactly the same way.” Later,<i>“</i>structural signature” and “unique finished product” reinforce this point.</li>
              <li>The passage explains that master smiths were not considered artists in the classical sense, and then goes on to point out the painstaking creation of each sword. This implicitly draws a parallel between the creation of the sword and classical artistry. However, the passage does not actually describe or discuss classical artists, nor does it set forth criteria for classical artists. There is no actual comparison to classical artists, despite the mention of “artistic merit.” This answer choice goes too far beyond the passage.</li>
              <li>Elements of the forging process are discussed, but the “complete” process of making a Japanese sword, such as making the handle, polishing the blade, etc., is not discussed in the paragraph.</li>

                <b>CORRECT.</b> The second-to-last sentence says that “each smith’s secret forging techniques left an idiosyncratic structural signature.” This structural signature, then, could possibly be used to determine the creator of a given sword, even in the absence of a physical signature.</li>
              <li>

            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b>
            </p>
            <p>The Chicago airport is busy and very large, consisting of several small stand-alone terminals. Despite this, John thinks he will make his connecting flight. </p>

            </p>
            <p>The correct answer choice will make it a little more likely that John’s conclusion is valid. The information needs to support the idea that he’ll make the connecting flight despite the size of the airport.</p>

              <li> Slash.

The fact that his connecting flight will probably depart on time might even weaken the argument. </li>
              <li> Slash. Airlines have been known to delay flights in order to ensure that a large number of passengers can make the connection, but you should not have to make an additional assumption in order to say that this choice strengthens the given conclusion.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> Strengthen. John will not have to take a tram to another terminal in order to reach his connecting flight. The premises describe the individual terminals as “small.” If he can walk to his next flight in a small terminal, then 30 minutes is likely enough time to make the connection.</li>
              <li> Slash. This choice is out of scope. The argument concludes that John will make his current flight; the following flight has no bearing on John’s ability to catch the flight on which he is currently booked.</li>
              <li> Slash/Weaken. If anything, this choice weakens the idea that John will catch the connecting flight by shortening the length of time he has to get to the second flight’s gate. He now has only 20 minutes, not 30.</li>

            <b>opacity, inscrutability</b>
            <p> Joyce’s book is described as “stream-of-consciousness,” with “convoluted puns and obscure allusions.” The adjectives “convoluted” and “obscure” are the most important parts of this sentence. They tell you that the novel is likely hard to understand. A good fill-in would be <i>difficulty</i> (specifically, of understanding).</p>
            <p><i>Elaborateness </i>(marked by complex detail; intricacy),<i> meaninglessness </i>(nonsense),<i> informality </i>(relaxed style), and <i>uniqueness </i>(the quality of being one of a kind)have no relationship. While <i>meaninglessness </i>might seem tempting, it’s too extreme to be correct.</p>
