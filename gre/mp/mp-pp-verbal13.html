            <p>73. <b>Groaning.</b> You might feel stuck if the idiom “groan under the strain” isn’t familiar to you, but process of elimination can still work here. The part of the sentence following the colon must be equivalent—either an example or a restatement—to the part before it. The word that fills the blank must make “city infrastructure is already _________ under the strain of excess auto traffic” a good reason to create bike lanes in the city. Since bike lanes would help to relieve the traffic burden, the blank must mean something like struggling. “Groaning,” which is something that a person struggling with a heavy load would do, is used figuratively here. The words “seething” (very angry), “waiting,” “baying” (yelling loudly), and “intensifying” don’t create an image of a person struggling under a heavy load the way that “groaning” does and so are not correct.</p>

            <p>74. <b>Heterodox, iconoclasm, abolition.</b> The first two blanks both describe the professor’s tendencies and should have a similar meaning. The clue for those blanks follows the colon: “she persistently challenged the academic methods and the institutional procedures of her department and of the university as a whole.” For the first blank, “intellectual” is a theme trap. “Illiberal” means narrow-minded and does not describe someone who challenges institutions and established procedures. “Heterodox” (unorthodox or not in accordance with established thought) is a good match. Similarly, for the second blank, “iconoclasm” (opposing established beliefs) fits, while “intelligence” is another theme trap and “theories” does not match the desired meaning. The last blank describes arguing for doing something to “inherently elitist institutions” to democratize education. Since getting rid of universities entirely would have that effect, “abolition” is a great fit. “Enshrinement” (to cherish as sacred) is a reversal trap and “mitigation” (make less severe) is too mild to match the language “going so far as.”</p>

            <p>75. <b>Belies.</b> The phrase “apparent simplicity” is the clue that indicates that there is more to coffee than meets the eye. This sentence sets up a contrast between the phrases (“apparent simplicity” and “dizzying number of hours of toil”) that are both used to describe coffee; the word that fills the blank must be a contrast word. “Confirms,” “furnishes,” and “fosters” (supports) are all incorrect because those words would be used to connect two phrases that agreed with each other. “Redresses” (corrects or rights a wrong) could be used for an opposite connection but doesn’t fit here because there is no sense that the “simplicity” is correcting all those hours of work. “Belies” (to be at odds with) is most appropriate here.</p>

            <p>76. <b>Unkempt, surprisingly deliberate.</b> The tricky blank structure masks what is ultimately a not-so-tricky word relationship: that of opposites. The clues for this relationship are the words “notwithstanding” and “if.” The first part of the sentence says that in spite of the clutter of tools lying about, the studio was orderly. The part after the semicolon talks about the décor, and the idiomatic structure “if X, Y” is used to show a similar contrast. The first blank must match “cluttered,” and the second must match “orderly.” The best match for cluttered is “unkempt,” and the better match for orderly is “surprisingly deliberate,” because something that is deliberate is not random and so must have a certain order to it. The words “dire” (dreadful or grim) and “arduous” (difficult) may describe the way some people feel about clutter, but do not describe a cluttered décor. Similarly, “unsophisticated” (simple) and “callous” (uncaring) do not describe an orderly décor.</p>

            <p>77. <b>Heralded, appropriated.</b> The phrase “equally public” provides a clue that the legislator’s approval was also highly publicized, or “heralded.” “Ratified,” which means officially approved, would be redundant in this context. The sentence does not indicate that anyone “scorned” (rejected or was disdainful of) the approval. The sentence doesn’t provide much of a clue for the second blank. When this happens, only one answer choice will make sense (and usually that correct choice won’t add much to the sentence), while the other, incorrect answer choices will drastically change the meaning. Here, “appropriated,” which means allocated or assigned, fits nicely and doesn’t add any unintended meaning. Neither “stolen” nor “exacerbated” (made worse) is an appropriate description of funding that was approved by a legislature.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="BE">
            <p>78. <b>Benign, decamped.</b> The first blank hinges on the meaning of the word “purportedly,” which means pretending to be, or masquerading as. The sentence implies that the bureau is pretending to be harmless, or “benign.” It wouldn’t make sense to say that the bureau pretended that its “inquisitions” (inquiries or questionings) were “suspicious”; that word is an opposite trap. The sentence does not suggest that the inquisitions were “risqué” (sexually suggestive). The second blank requires a word that means to leave hurriedly; “decamped” fits. The word “immigrated,” though close in meaning, isn’t quite right because it means to arrive at a country or region rather than to leave from it. “Immigrated” is especially tricky because is sounds very similar to the word emigrated, which does mean to leave a country or region and move to another one. “Pandered,” which means indulged another’s desire, is not appropriate in this sentence.</p>

She appears affable, or friendly, but her friends have mixed feelings about this. The blank must mean something like genuine. “Sincere” isn’t too hard to spot as a match, but the other correct answer, “unaffected,” is a trickier word, used to describe someone who is genuine and sincere. “Amiable” and “genial” both mean friendly, and thus are trap answers that fit with the first half of the sentence but not the blank in the second half. “Magnanimity,” which means generosity, and “vexing,” which means annoying, are also not good fits.</p>

She is paying “fines and restitution” and she must also have to do something else negative (for her) relative to her role in the company. “Abjured” and “forwent” both work here; she is giving up her position and financial stake in the company. “Reneged” means to break a promise; she can’t “renege a role.” Similarly, a leader can be “deposed,” but you don’t depose a role. The hedge fund founder may be “censured” (probably worse), but it doesn’t make sense for her to “censure” (disapprove of, reprimand) her role.

This contrast is reinforced in the second half of the sentence, which points to a contradiction between “violence” and “love.” The blank must mean something like going against “the most basic ethical tenets,” making “breaching” and “contravening” correct. “Obeying” and “heeding,” which both mean follow, are trap answers and are opposite the required meaning.

The biggest clue to that state of mind is the phrase “passing thoughts and inconstant moods,” which means the answer will mean changeable, impermanent, or inconsistent. The best answers are “ephemeral” and “fleeting.” “Vestigial,” or a remnant of something, does not fit. “Essential” might work, but there’s no indication that the changeable aspects of the mind are necessary. “Evasive” (trying to avoid something) does not have the right meaning. “Inchoate,” meaning not fully formed, is tempting but does not form a pair with any other answer.</p>

However, this would be impossible (because of the word “forever”), and thus the idea is not falsifiable. In addition, answer choices (A) through (D) are incorrect. The statement “All birds are black” is falsifiable by identifying a single bird that is not black. The statement “Earth is the only planet in the universe with intelligent life” can be proven false by finding intelligent life on any planet in the universe except Earth. The statement “It rains on Mars every day” can be proven false by observing Mars on a single non-rainy day. The statement “The sun will explode in 100,000 years” can be proven false by waiting more than 100,000 years and verifying that the sun has not exploded. Note that choices (D) and (E) seem somewhat similar—however impractical it is to wait 100,000 years to falsify something, there is still a big difference between “100,000 years” and “forever.”</p>

          <p>”Falsifiability” is the term coined by Karl Popper for the idea that a hypothesis or theoryaddresses the observable world only insofar as it can be found false as the result of someobservation or physical experiment. For instance, the proposition “all cats have fur” can easilybe proven false with the observation of a single hairless cat. The proposition “the world will end in the year 3035” is impractical to falsify, but still passes the test of falsifiability in thatthere exists the logical possibility that 3035 will come and go without the world ending. To thecontrary, it is possible to posit that everything that happens is the will of Zeus. No matter whatexperiment we design—such as praying to Zeus to give us the answer or daring Zeus to strikeus with lightning—we can always infer that the result is the will of Zeus. Such a proposition, as conceived here, is not falsifiable. Popper claimed that a falsifiable theory is the only kind thatcan truly be scientific, or at least useful to the scientific community. “confirmability.”</p>

            <p>87. <b>(C).</b> The second paragraph focuses on the significance of the two definitions of “political,” as (C) states. Choice (A) is incorrect because no alternative is offered in the second paragraph. Choice (B) is incorrect because there is no “revision”—this choice might describe the third paragraph. Similarly, in (D), there is no “exception.” Choice (E) is closer to the point of the first paragraph.</p>

          <p>A dictionary definition of the term “political” might read something like, “of or concernedwith government, political parties, or politicians.” Such a definition is not precisely wrong,but rather is outdated and falls short by not accounting for what Nancy Fraser calls “the shiftfrom a repressive model of domination to a hegemonic one.” If at some point we believed governments to operate exclusively through law and the threat and enforcement of concretepunishment, such as imprisonment, monetary penalties, etc., and called this and everythingthat directly influenced it “politics,” we have now acknowledged the role of hegemony, whichlegitimizes law and supports the exercise of power. be said to be political must explicitly address issues of political partisanship or governance,while under the second definition, all cultural objects can be traced to a certain ideology—inaccordance, negotiation, or opposition to hegemony—and therefore be political. (at least potentially) political, not all talk is so. When conducting her study on political talk, NinaEliasoph focused not as much on what people talked about, but rather on how exactly theytalked about things: “whether speakers ever assume that what they say matters for someoneother than themselves, ever assume that they are speaking in front of a wider backdrop.” Shecited Hanna Pitkin in concluding that “public-spirited conversation happens when citizens speak in terms of ‘justice’.” To use an example from the theater, then, we can say that when adirector decides to frame her production of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> as the story of a womanwho is losing her mind and does not get along with her aggressive brother-in-law, she isactively depoliticizing the story, whereas she is actively politicizing it if she decides to frame thenarrative as one example of the devastating effects of an old bourgeois morality, a changing economic system, and the social valuing of an abusive model of masculinity.</p>

            <p>(A)High schools would be wise to incorporate personal finance classes into their core curricula.</p>

            <p>(E)The majority of high school students have no financial responsibilities to their families.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>31. <b>(C).</b> This passage relates information from two studies concerning high school seniors: the first discusses the financial responsibilities of high school seniors, while the second explains the coursework in finance taken by typical high school seniors. On the GRE, a proper response to a Draw a Conclusion question must directly follow from the evidence in the passage.</p>
            <p>(A) Although it might be true that schools would be wise to educate students in finance, this is an opinion that does not have to be true based upon the given evidence.</p>
            <p>(B) That one-third of high school seniors claim “significant financial responsibilities” to their families does not necessarily mean that these same students work “part-time jobs after school.” There are many ways that these students might earn money for their families. If they do work, they might work on weekends or over the summer.</p>
            <p><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> The first study states that one-third of all high school seniors have significant financial responsibilities to their families. The second study states that 80% of seniors have opened a bank account, and of this 80%, one-third have bounced a check. The number of seniors that has bounced a check (one-third of 80%) is fewer than the number of seniors with significant financial responsibilities to their families (one-third of 100%).</p>
            <p>(D) The passage states that certain high school seniors who contribute to the food, shelter, or clothing for themselves or their families “rate themselves” as having significant financial responsibilities. This does not mean that any high school senior who contributes to these categories has significant financial responsibilities.</p>
            <p>(E) The passage states that one-third of high school seniors say that they have “significant financial responsibilities.” This does not indicate that the other two-thirds have no responsibilities. Because no information is given about the other two-thirds of the students, no conclusion about them must follow.</p>

          <p> According to a recent study on financial roles, one-third of high school seniors say that they have “significant financial responsibilities.” These responsibilities include, but are not limited to, contributing to food, shelter, or clothing for themselves or their families. At the same time, a second study demonstrates that a crisis in money management exists for high school students. According to this study, 80% of high school seniors have never taken a personal finance class even though the same percentage of seniors has opened bank accounts and one-third of these account holders has bounced a check.</p>

            <p>32. <b>(E).</b> According to the statements, the companies that own private aircraft for business use are fully in compliance with the relevant law. A correct inference must follow from at least part of the premises given.</p>
            <p>(A) It does not have to be true that the law costs the businesses money as no evidence about the relative costs is given.</p>
            <p>(B) This choice is an irrelevant comparison as the preferences of the executives are not the concern of the statements.</p>
            <p>(C) This choice does not have to follow as there is no information given about the travel arrangements made by large companies. The statements only indicate that the majority of private planes are not owned by large companies.</p>
            <p>(D) There is no information given about the travel arrangements of upper level executives and no reason to believe that those with the companies discussed do not comply with their companies’ policies.</p>
            <p><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> If, as the statements indicate, the companies are in full compliance with this law, it must be true that the executives following their guidelines also are.</p>

          <p> Federal law prohibits businesses from reimbursing any employees for the cost of owning and operating a private aircraft that is used for business purposes. Thus, many companies in the United States themselves purchase private aircraft. The vast majority of the business aviation fleet is owned by small and mid-size businesses, and flights are strictly for business purposes, with mostly mid-level employees on board. These companies and their boards of directors are in full compliance with the law and with what is best for their businesses.</p>

            <p>Which of the following pieces of information, if true, weakens the conclusion above?</p>

          <div class="choices">
            <p>(A)Some doctors who submit accurate bills to insurance companies still receive tardy payments.</p>
            <p>(B)The cost to the insurance companies to process incorrect bills from doctors’ offices is roughly equivalent to the increased costs that physicians accrue as a result of tardy payments from insurance companies.</p>
            <p>(C)A rising proportion of medical claims submitted by doctors to insurance companies are deemed illegitimate by those insurance companies.</p>
            <p>(D)The billing errors made by doctors’ offices are typically very minor, such as the submission of a claim with an outdated patient home address.</p>
            <p>(E)The overhead costs incurred by doctors as a result of delayed insurance payments result in an increase in the premiums paid by consumers to health insurance companies that far exceeds any increase in the fees paid to doctors by insurance companies.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>33. <b>(E).</b> The conclusion of the argument is that insurance companies do not have a significant economic incentive to delay claim payments to doctors. To weaken this conclusion, an answer choice must provide some significant economic incentive for insurance companies to be tardy in paying doctors for legitimate medical claims.</p>
            <p>(A) While the fact that some doctors who submit accurate bills to insurance companies still receive tardy payments seems to indicate that there must be something other than errors causing delayed payments, it fails to prove that the insurance company has an economic incentive to deliberately delay claim payments to doctors. For example, this fact could simply indicate that the insurance companies are inefficient at handling their paperwork.</p>
            <p>(B) This choice compares the costs insurance companies must absorb due to incorrect bills to the costs physicians must absorb due to tardy payments. However, this information does not establish an economic incentive for insurance companies to delay claim payments to doctors.</p>
            <p>(C) The argument is focused on the payment of legitimate claims; the rising proportion of illegitimate claims does not establish a clear economic incentive for insurance companies to delay payments of legitimate claims.</p>
            <p>(D) The types of billing errors made by doctors’ offices does not establish any economic motive for insurance companies to delay payments to doctors.</p>
            <p><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> This choice articulates a logical chain that establishes a clear economic motive for insurance companies to delay paying doctors for legitimate medical claims. If insurance companies delay payments to doctors, this results in a 10% increase in overhead costs for physicians. These costs ultimately result in higher fees that doctors charge to insurance companies. Insurance companies, in turn, raise the premiums that they charge consumers for health coverage. This choice states that the insurance companies increase their fees to consumers far more than the doctors increase their fees to insurance companies, enabling the insurance companies to pocket the difference; therein lies the economic motive for insurance companies to be tardy paying doctors for legitimate medical claims.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="passage5" class="passage">
          <p> Experts estimate that insurance companies’ tardiness in paying doctors for legitimate medical claims adds approximately 10% in overhead costs for physicians. Insurance companies counter that the tardiness sometimes results from billing errors made by the doctors themselves. Since dealing with these billing errors costs the insurance companies time and money, it is clear that insurance companies do not have a significant economic incentive to delay claim payments to doctors.</p>
