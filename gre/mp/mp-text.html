            <p class="body-text"><b>1. Defunct.</b> The show stagnated and was canceled, so afterward it might appear to be “dead” or “gone.” <b>Defunct</b> (no longer existing) is a good match. A <b>lackluster</b> (dull) show might be cancelled, but it doesn't make sense that Doctor Who appeared to be dull <b>after</b> it was cancelled, and this would clash with the fact that the show returned in 2005 and had success. A canceled show is unlikely to appear in a positive light, such as <b>ascendant</b> (upwardly moving) or <b>unflagging</b> (not tiring; steady and unrelenting). <b>Sated</b> (fully satisfied, maybe too much) doesn't make sense in this context.</p>

The scandal seemed poised to ruin things—that is, it hadn't done so already. What makes the most sense here is that the scandal itself hadn't quite broken yet—it was only <b>looming</b> (taking shape as an impending event).

You don't have any indication that the forces were <b>fascistic</b> (totalitarian, led by dictator). <b>Outclassed</b> (surpassed in quality) is irrelevant here, so <b>revolting</b> fits best. Don't be thrown off by the dual meaning of <b>revolting</b>—certainly <b>revolting</b> can mean disgusting, but it can also mean engaging in a revolt, such as against a government. The loyalist battalion was helped or strengthened by “its allies’ reinforcements,” so only <b>bolstered</b> (supported) makes sense. <b>Obviated</b> (anticipated and made unnecessary) isn't indicated by any clue in the sentence. <b>Sapped</b> (weakened, especially of energy) conflicts with the idea that allies would help the loyalists.</p>

            <p class="body-text"><b>16. Fairness, catharsis, denouement.</b> There is a contrast between “exploitation and iniquity” and what the film is actually concerned with: the first blank must be the opposite of exploitation or iniquity, that is, <b>fairness</b>. <b>Slavery</b> and <b>injustice</b> are theme traps in agreement with “exploitation and iniquity”; both don't fit considering the pivots “though” and “nevertheless.” The film showcases “the elimination of all the protagonist's abusers,” which grants the audience something like “closure.” The audience hasn't been waiting for <b>inconclusiveness</b>. Maybe it has been waiting for <b>relief</b>, but <b>catharsis</b> is a better fit, since it refers specifically to purging of built-up emotions. Finally, the plot is building up to a resolution, or <b>denouement</b>. A <b>platitude</b> (trite saying) might leave “much to be desired,” but wouldn't provide a “satisfying upheaval.” There is no indication that the conclusion of the film was an <b>embellishment</b> (an untrue detail added to a story to make it more interesting).</p>

            <p class="body-text2s"><b>20. Warrant, license.</b> It is clear from “claims” and the generally derisive tone of the sentence that the author does not think it is possible to deduce matters of fact from logic (that would be pretty silly, come to think about it). Thus, the “she” who is the subject of the text has little <b>warrant</b> (justification) for doing this, and just as little <b>warrant</b> for using logic to inappropriately derive other “<b>truths</b>.” A <b>fallacy</b> is a “mistaken belief, especially one based on unsound argument”—she has lots of <b>fallacies</b>, not the dearth of <b>fallacy</b> indicated by “just as little.” An <b>epigram</b> is a “witticism” or “quip,” an extra meaning not indicated by any clues. <b>License</b> is similar to <b>warrant</b> and serves the same function in the second sentence. The “laws of logic” do not <b>occlude</b> (close, cover, or obstruct) or <b>galvanize</b> (spur to action) “her proclamation.”</p>
