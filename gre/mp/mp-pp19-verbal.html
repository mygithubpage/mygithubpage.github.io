            <p>109. <b>Attest to, quotidian.</b> “Just as … so too … ” suggests that the mainstream novels show a gift, just as the science-fiction novels do. The first word should mean something like show, or display. Among these answers, only “attest” has that meaning. Incorrect choices “belie” and “gainsay” both indicate an opposite direction. The second word should describe the world of mainstream, rather than science-fiction, novels: something not fantastic, but just ordinary or everyday. “Quotidian” has just that meaning. “Fantastical” (odd and bizarre) and “ebullient” (cheerful and exuberant) don’t, in general, describe the ordinary, everyday world.</p>

            <p>110. <b>Solvent.</b> If a company is far from “flourishing” (prospering), it is not doing well, even if the report “avers” (swears) that it is. “Solvent” means profitable; a “not profitable” company is definitely not doing well. “Thriving” is very tempting but ignores the expression “let alone flourishing.” The correct use of the expression “not X, let alone Y,” requires that X be at a lower level or be an intermediate step towards Y, as in “The paper was not even comprehensible, let alone informative.” Since “thriving” is on the same level as “flourishing,” it can’t logically be used here. “Copious” (detailed), “evasive,” and “unprecedented” don’t fit with “let alone flourishing” either.</p>

            <p>111. <b>Supplants, contemptible.</b> “Requisite” means made necessary by circumstances or regulation, so “a requisite amount of regulatory pressure” is the normal, suitable, or necessary amount of pressure on “a business.” But what does <i>this</i> business do? Regarding “pressure” about “industry safety standards,” the business [does something to] “its own non-compliance … with yet another series of suspect omissions.” The blanks must make the sentence generally read this way: A business that [replaces or substitutes = blank (i)] bad safety standards with “yet another” set of bad safety standards is very [bad = blank (ii)]. “Supplants” is a synonym for replaces and “contemptible” means despicable or deplorable, so these choices fit. “Imbue” means inspire or permeate with some characteristic or feeling. “Non-compliance” could be said to be imbued with “omissions” of compliance, but “yet another” separates and distinguishes the “omissions” from the original “non-compliance”; the context and structure of the sentence make this choice wrong. “Verifies” is too positive in the first blank and “laudable,” or worthy of praise, is too positive in the second blank. There is no indication in the sentence that a business that behaves this way is “contrived,” which means unrealistic or artificially created.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>112. <b>Draconian.</b> “Belied” means contradicted or was at odds with. Thus, the boss’s on-the-job style is contradicted by his “amiable,” or warm, friendly style in the interview. The clue is that the young hire (the new employee) experiences “chagrin,” which is mental distress or unease. “Draconian,” which means harsh, strict, or severe, is best. Don’t be confused by “nonplussed,” the primary meaning of which is confused or surprised—it doesn’t capture the boss’s strictness. The answer “friendly” is a trap for anyone who doesn’t notice the word “belied” earlier in the sentence. “Fatuous” (silly and pointless) is a great GRE word, but doesn’t match the intended meaning. “Illicit” (illegal) goes too far: there is nothing in the sentence to suggest that the boss is behaving illegally.</p>

            <p>113. <b>An exhaustive, remarkable variance.</b> The first blank is tricky; start with the second one. “Fluctuations” cause the “most reliable” wines to be something like unpredictable. Only “remarkable variance” fits. “Taxonomy” is a classification system and “mitigating circumstances” are circumstances that make something less severe or serious. If even the “reliable vintages” exhibit a large variance, then it must be difficult to have full, or “exhaustive,” comprehension of Italian wines. “Futile” (ineffective) and “irredeemable” (unable to be saved or helped) do not fit the desired meaning.</p>

            <p>114. <b>Casual nonchalance, farce.</b> If the clerk treats his office (a fancy way to say his job) with a general lack of respect, then he treats his clients with a similarly cool and distant manner, a manner of “casual nonchalance.” “Meticulous” (careful and precise) is positive and “envy” is not indicated by the sentence. As for the second blank, knowing that “grand farce” is a common English idiom is helpful but is not essential—the word “farce,” or mockery, is the only word that fits. A “grand gesture” would be positive (a “grand gesture” would be something like an elaborate marriage proposal, apology, etc.), and it is not possible to treat one’s entire job like a “grand tirade” (angry speech).</p>

            <p>109. <b>Extirpated, obliterated.</b> This sentence is about as purely definition-based as you can get: the house was torn from the ground and utterly destroyed. “Extirpated” and “obliterated” both fit. “Tethered” means tied to something. “Recapitulated” means to summarize and is better known by its shortened version: recap. “Interred” means to place in a grave or tomb. And “hallowed” means to make holy or to be greatly revered. None of the latter four options form a pair, nor do any of them fit the context of this sentence.</p>

            <p>110. <b>Debacle, rout.</b> If the team has no chance of winning the game in the third quarter, the game must have been a crushing failure or a drubbing. “Debacle” and “rout” fit well. Note that a “boondoggle” is certainly bad, but it is an unnecessary and wasteful project. “Forgery” means fake and there’s nothing fake about a bad loss. “Fallacy” means a mistaken belief and “infirmity” means a physical or mental illness, neither of which fits this sentence.</p>

Of the answer choices, “aver” and “assert” are near synonyms that would complete the sentence in a similar way. “Suspect” could possibly work here, but there is no other word that produces a sentence with the same meaning. The remaining options all provide opposite tones for the sentence.

            <p>112. <b>Rift, breach.</b> “Incontrovertible” indicates that there were issues that were once totally accepted by both parties. Now they are “subject to contention,” indicating that there is a widening gap, or fissure, between the parties: a “rift” or “breach” between them. Note that the other four answer choices do not have a pair among them, nor do their meanings reflect the intended meaning of the sentence. An “accord,” or treaty, would be the opposite of what the sentence suggests. And though the fissure between the parties might be considered by some to be upsetting, there is not a “travesty” between the parties. “Piety” can mean either the quality of being religious/reverent or a belief that is held with reverence, but neither meaning fits here. And finally, “prevalence,” which means commonplace, also does not fit with the clues in the sentence.</p>

          <p>Cells employ many strategies to avoid genetic mutation. From the high fidelity ofDNA-synthesizing enzymes to the pro-death signaling that accompanies mutagenic stimuli suchas UV radiation, cellular mechanisms that stymie genetic changes are ubiquitous throughoutthe natural world. These mechanisms are critical because widespread genomic changes would wreak physiological havoc; indeed, malfunctions in molecular players that safeguard againstmutagenesis, such as the protein p53, have been implicated in diseases such as cancer. One such instance is observed in vertebrate immune systems: white blood cells such as Tcells recognize invading pathogens through receptors on their surfaces. In order to recognizea wide variety of pathogens, these cells must generate a large repertoire of receptors. Relyingonly on a genetically encoded repertoire would be disadvantageously limiting—analogousto having only a few dozen language phrases with which to respond to the nearly infinite potential combinations of words in a conversation. Instead, the repertoire is generated bya process of genetic recombination, in which T cells “cut-and-paste” the DNA encodingtheir microbe-recognizing receptors. Many of these genetic rearrangements produce cellsbearing non-functional proteins; such unproductive cells are eliminated through senescence.Nevertheless, this seemingly haphazard process of programmed genetic mutation is crucial to generating immunological diversity, as individuals with defects in this pathway exhibit clinicalimmunodeficiency. How this process is regulated by T cells to prevent harmful mutationsremains the subject of ongoing research.</p>

            <p>130. <b>(A).</b> According to the passage, T cells need a large repertoire of receptors in order to be able to recognize a wide variety of pathogens. The passage goes on to say that “[r]elying only on a genetically encoded repertoire would be disadvantageously limiting—analogous to having only a few dozen language phrases with which to respond to the nearly infinite potential combinations of words in a conversation. Instead, the repertoire is generated by a process of genetic recombination … ” According to this analogy, the language phrases are the repertoire of receptors; just as a speaker must respond to a nearly infinite body of language combinations, T cells must also have a large repertoire so they can respond to a wide variety of pathogens. This repertoire is increased through genetic recombination. Choice (A) is correct. Note that choice (B) is out of scope, choice (C) is the exact opposite of what is being described, choice (D) is a distortion based on another analogy in the passage (also, an analogy on the GRE would not be “meant to elucidate” <i>another</i> analogy!), and choice (E) refers to the first paragraph, not the analogy in question.</p>

The “nearly infinite potential combinations of words” is what a speaker must respond to—the reason a speaker needs a wide repertoire of language. Similarly, the wide variety of pathogens is the reason T cells need such a wide variety of receptors. This supports the first statement only.</p>

          <p>Martin Haberman pulls no punches in his scathing critique of the insensitive and unjusttreatment received by children in poverty in the public school system. He focuses the brunt ofhis criticism on teachers who have been insufficiently trained for the realities of the modernschool environment and whose prejudices, lack of deep content knowledge, and excessive focus on order and discipline profoundly limit their effectiveness. Haberman writes, “theprinciples and theories we call child and adolescent development were all developed toexplain the middle-class experience,” and that everyone else in public schools, includingnon-white, immigrant, or non-English-speaking children, are considered somehow anomalies, thusleading to the absurd situation in which a teacher completes teacher training and is put in front of a class of students she considers to be made entirely of “exceptions.”</p>

            <p>46. <b>(B).</b> The argument claims that no one with a compromised immune system should travel to Nicaragua’s “Mosquito Coast,” due to the risk of contracting dengue fever or malaria. The correct answer choice is the choice that does not strengthen the argument. Therefore, the four wrong answers must each strengthen the argument.</p>
            <p>(A) Strengthens. Since the method of preventing or treating one of the diseases can have adverse side effects, the danger is made worse, particularly for people with compromised immune systems.</p>
            <p><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> If the government were to succeed in this effort, there would be somewhat less risk to travelers with compromised immune systems. This would weaken the conclusion that such travelers should avoid the Mosquito Coast. If the effort were to fail, it would produce no change in the danger to such travelers. Either way, this answer choice does nothing to strengthen the argument that such travelers should avoid the Mosquito Coast.</p>
            <p>(C) Strengthens. Since a compromised immune system doesn’t effectively fight either dengue fever or malaria, people with such immune systems are at increased risk of infection by such diseases.</p>
            <p>(D) Strengthens. The populations of both mosquitoes grow during rainy season; thus, the chance of contracting either disease also grows.</p>
            <p>(E) Strengthens. The insect repellent may be the most effective available, but it can also have a terrible side effect. Using this repellent is one of the options for dealing with the risk of mosquito-borne disease. Since this option is more dangerous than before, the travel advisory is strengthened.</p>

            <p>47. <b>(D).</b> According to the text, the Peruvian government claims that Inca Trail treasures would have deteriorated without a new permit program that has restricted the number of tourists. The correct answer will strengthen this claim.</p>
            <p>(A) Irrelevant. The increase in pay may have resulted from the permit program, but there is no direct connection to preservation of the Inca Trail.</p>
            <p>(B) Irrelevant. Local villages may have seen a drop in income as a result of the restrictions on tourist numbers, but this does not strengthen or weaken the claim that the permit program prevented Inca Trail ruins from deteriorating.</p>
            <p>(C) Irrelevant. The funds are a positive result of the permit program, but if these funds are used to protect or preserve archaeology elsewhere, then they do not impact the preservation of ruins specifically on the Inca Trail.</p>
            <p><b>(D) CORRECT.</b> The more rapid deterioration of similar ruins elsewhere supports the claim that the permit program has helped prevent deterioration of Inca Trail ruins. Notice that this evidence does not rise to the level of absolute proof; other differences between the ruins might explain the different rates of deterioration. However, this evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that the permit program was successful.</p>
            <p>(E) Irrelevant. Without the permit program, it is possible (though far from certain) that the number of tourists hiking the Inca Trail would have risen together with the total number of tourists visiting Peru. However, an increase in the number of tourists on the Inca Trail would not necessarily have led to greater deterioration of archaeological treasures on the trail.</p>

          <p> In 2001, the Peruvian government began requiring tourists to buy expensive permits to hike the remote Inca Trail, which goes to the ancient city of Machu Picchu. The total number of permits is strictly limited; in fact, only 500 people per day are now allowed to hike the Inca Trail, whereas before 2001, visitors numbered in the thousands.

            <p>48. <b>(E).</b> The chairman claims that same-day spending at downtown businesses by people attending performances at the Farmsley Center has contributed to the economic revitalization of downtown Metropolis. His argument depends on the assumption that this spending represents an increased flow of money into the economy of downtown Metropolis. If, for example, the $83 per visitor that he cites is money that would have been spent in downtown businesses even if the Farmsley Center had not been built, the chairman’s argument would be unsound.</p>
            <p>(A) Irrelevant. This choice does not specify the contributions to the city that led to the honor. Perhaps the chairman was honored for activities unrelated to the Farmsley Center, or perhaps he was honored simply because Metropolis residents feel civic pride at having a grand performance space downtown.</p>
            <p>(B) Irrelevant. Expensive restaurants may be a sign of the economic revitalization of downtown Metropolis, but they do not indicate the causal factors that led to the revitalization.</p>
            <p>(C) Irrelevant. In the absence of information specifically relating the architecture of the Farmsley Center to spending at downtown businesses, it does not have to follow that the architect’s international standing has helped in the economic revitalization downtown.</p>
            <p>(D) Irrelevant. The Farmsley Center may host performances that would otherwise have taken place at other downtown venues, but this does not mean that extra money is spent downtown.</p>
            <p><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> If suburbanites are coming to Metropolis to see performances at the Farmsley Center, they are bringing money from out of town and spending it in downtown Metropolis.
