            <p>91. <b>Apathy, diligence.</b> “As opposed” indicates a reversal between what happened in Boehm’s undergraduate years and during his doctoral program, which is also indicated by the switch from “hedonism,” or pleasure-seeking, to “earnest devotion,” probably to academic studies, as this devotion “led to academic laurels.” The first blank should either match “hedonism” or contrast “devotion,” and the second blank should match “earnest devotion” or be something related to academic success. The best answers are “apathy,” indifference or lack of interest, and “diligence,” commitment or hard work. “Studiousness” would be a good fit for the second blank, but is an opposite trap in the first blank. There are no clues to suggest that he was deceitful, or exhibiting “duplicity.” In the second blank, “morality” might <i>feel</i> right: if your personal view is that “hedonism” is immoral, this would provide the contrast required. However, pleasure-seeking is not <i>by definition</i> immoral, any more than “morality” would necessarily lead to academic laurels. “Detachment” means indifference, so it’s a near synonym of “apathy”; it’s another opposite trap that would work well in the other blank, but not in blank (ii).</p>

            <p>92. <b>Land, a plum.</b> The first blank needs to be a synonym of get. “Ascertain” does not fit that meaning, and “ensure” is used incorrectly—the actress might want to ensure that she gets the part, but it doesn’t make sense to say that she wants to “ensure the part” itself. The second blank should describe a role with “lots of onscreen time” and good scenes; you need a synonym for good. That’s exactly what “plum” means. “Grave” (important or harmful) and “theatrical” (relating to theater or overly dramatic in a negative way) do not fit the desired meaning.</p>

            <p>93. <b>Touchstone</b> You need a clue that matches “more than a hit movie” and goes with the idea of having meaning for a whole generation of people. “Touchstone,” or something used to make judgments about other things, matches perfectly. “Cornerstone” doesn’t work—a cultural touchstone is a single important event, place, work of art, etc. A “cultural cornerstone” would be something the whole society is built upon (like individualism, Islam, or the monarchy, depending on the society). A “rudder” is literally part of a ship related to steering; if you are lost in life, you are like a ship without a rudder. A “bolster” is pretty similar to a “stanchion,” at least when used metaphorically to mean a support (literally, a “bolster” is a pillow, and a “stanchion” is an upright bar or post), so neither is the answer.</p>

            <p>95. <b>Mask, part and parcel.</b> The sentence says that people who work in the service industry “put on a smile for the customer,” implying that they hide their true emotions in some way. “Masquerade” is close, but it means either to pretend to be someone or to be disguised as something else; neither meaning works for the first blank. To “simulate” emotions is to pretend to feel them, not to hide them, which doesn’t work either, so the correct answer for the first blank is “mask.” For the second blank, you need something like a requirement. “Apex” is a high point (i.e., The apex of my career was playing for the Knicks). “Conceit” means a fanciful notion. “Part and parcel,” meaning an essential piece of something, is the correct phrase.</p>

Both “underpins” and “undergirds” fit this meaning. “Irradiates” means either to expose to radiation or to illuminate. “Underserves” means to fail to provide adequate services and does not make sense here. “Saturates” and “overwhelms” might be thought of as a pair, but would not be used in the same context, nor would these extreme words best fit the sentence.</p>

Mariposa’s character might be quite “dramatic,” but that would not contrast with the roles that involved many lines. “Melancholy” and “dejected” imply sadness, but not necessarily a refusal to speak (Hamlet is pretty depressed and he talks all the time). “Mute” goes too far: one can’t be more mute; rather, one would be mute if that person had no lines at all. “Laconic” and “curt” both match the idea that her character is not very talkative. Note that “curt” has the sense of being rudely short with people, whereas “laconic” is not necessarily negative, and while they aren’t perfect synonyms, the two correct answer choices do provide a similar meaning to the sentence.</p>

            <p>95. <b>Incendiary, demagogic.</b> The sentence is quite complex. It can often be helpful to reduce such a sentence down to its main core—eliminating the tacked-on modifiers—and then add the extra information back in as needed. Doing so here leaves you with: “The _________ nature of Thomas Paine’s political diatribes is now downplayed by government officials.” The word “diatribes” denotes strongly negative speech or writing, and, as such, their “nature” would more likely be controversial or fiery than understated or restrained. “Pallid,” which means pale or weak, forms a close, but incorrect, pair with “anemic.” “Antithetical” works superficially—it means directly opposed or mutually incompatible but it doesn’t connote a nature that would need to be downplayed. “Deferential,” meaning respectful, is the opposite of the needed meaning. That leaves the correct pair: “incendiary,” which means inflammatory and provocative, and “demagogic,” which refers to verbiage intended to arouse strong negative sentiments (usually against an established power).</p>

That leaves just two words. “Phlegmatic” means calm, cool, and collected, and “dispassionate” means unemotional and composed; both are more positive versions of “taciturn or brusque.”</p>

          <p>In traditional theater forms, the roles of performer and audience are completely separate,so that performance space can be said to encompass an actors’ sphere and a spectators’sphere. Even when performers move out into the audience or when there is scripted audienceinteraction, spectators do not become performers. Finally, while stories may open up the imagination or excite audiences, according to Augusto Boal, they discourage political action byproviding catharsis. The passive spectator follows the play’s emotional arc and, once the actionconcludes, finds the issue closed. Boal reminds us that our theater etiquette creates a kind ofculture of apathy where individuals do not act communally, despite shared space, and remaindistanced from art. Workshop theater, such as Boal’s Image Theatre and Forum Theatre, is a response tothat. In the workshop form, performance space is created for a select group of people, but theperformers’ sphere and the audience’s sphere are collapsed: everyone is at once theater makerand witness. In Image Theatre, participants will come up with a theme or issue and arrangethemselves into a tableau that depicts what that issue looks like in society today, versus what the ideal situation would be. They then try to transition from the current image to theideal image in a way that seems plausible to all the participants. Forum Theatre, on the otherhand, creates a narrative skit depicting a certain problem. After the actors have gone throughthe action of the play once, a facilitator, known as the joker (like the one in a pack of cards),encourages those who have watched the story to watch it again and to stop it at any time to take the place of the protagonist. The aim is to find a solution to the problem, realizing alongthe way all of the obstacles involved. In Forum Theatre, just as in Image Theatre, there is notalways a solution. The main goal of this form, then, is to engage in the action, to reflect, andto understand particular issues as being part of a larger picture, thus using art to re-cast whatseem like private troubles in a public, political light. The main reason Boal developed these workshop styles was to grant audiences agencyso that they may create ways to free themselves of oppression. Because he found theateraudiences to be locked into a passive role—just like he found the oppressed coerced into asubservient role in relation to their oppressors—he created the “spect-actor,” or someone whosimultaneously witnesses and creates theater.</p>

As for choice (B), Boal specifically says that catharsis keeps people passive (also, the audience member is not acting, which is crucial to being a “spect-actor”).

Choice (D) is too broad, given the first paragraph about traditional theater.</p>

It is believed that for a system of planets such as our solar systemto form around a star during cloud contraction, the presence of these heavy elements in thecloud is a necessity. critical measures of size, Jeans mass and Jeans length, can be calculated. If the size of thecloud exceeds either of these critical values, gravity will ultimately win, and the probability ofeventual cloud contraction is high. cloud, for instance. Surrounding supernovae can generate shockwaves powerful enough toaffect the debris in other clouds, forcing the debris inward and possibly causing contractionto begin.

          <p>The Norton-Polk-Mathis House in San Antonio displays an integrated design well-suitedto the primary purpose of the building: to impress. This is evidenced by the fact that thebuilding was designed with the street it faces in mind. Only the South façade is architecturallyinteresting or involved—the sides of the building are flat, featureless, and uninteresting. The house was designed not only as a living area, but also as a structure to be seen fromthe street. The building reflects typical Renaissance ideals of order and weight, and, whileit is asymmetrical, it is well balanced and stable. The choice of materials also reflects the“re-discovery” of antiquity prevalent in the Italian Renaissance.

However, if the number of rings lost by a Brazilian ash at high temperatures can be predicted, it may be possible to determine the age of a tree even if the temperature exceeds 95 degrees.</p>
            <p>(A) The argument says nothing about precipitation. This answer choice is out of scope since it would require a number of other assumptions to make it relevant to the argument’s conclusion.</p>

            <p><b>(E) CORRECT.</b> The conclusion is that the rings will be a reliable measure only if the temperature never exceeds 95 degrees.

          <p> The popular notion that a tree’s age can be determined by counting the number of internal rings in its trunk is generally true. However, to help regulate the internal temperature of the tree, the outermost layers of wood of the Brazilian ash often peel away when the temperature exceeds 95 degrees Fahrenheit, leaving the tree with fewer rings than it would otherwise have. So only if the temperature in the Brazilian ash’s environment never exceeds 95 degrees Fahrenheit will its rings be a reliable measure of the tree’s age.</p>
