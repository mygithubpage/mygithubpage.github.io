            <p>139. <b>Dissolute, damage, carefully cultivated.</b> The actor had some kind of behavior, but “unexpectedly” it “did little to _________ his reputation as a family man.” The first two blanks must contrast and should be selected together. If his behavior was “dissolute,” it was lax in morals, and thus surprising that it “did little to damage his reputation.” While negative, “impudent” (impertinent or disrespectful) behavior isn’t necessarily the same or the opposite of “family man” behavior. “Paternal” is exactly like fatherly, or “family man” behavior, so it would be unexpected only if “paternal behavior did little to help his reputation,” but no such meaning exists among the blank (ii) choices. “Assuage” means to make something less painful or severe, while “temper” means to neutralize or alleviate; both unjustly imply that “his reputation as a family man” is something unpleasant. The last blank is what “his exceptionally skilled team of publicists” did to his reputation: they “carefully cultivated,” or tried to develop (a quality, sentiment, or skill) his reputation. The team is “his,” so they shouldn’t work against his reputation, as both “cleverly subverted” (undermined) and “easily refuted” (discredited) would.</p>

The best match is “ubiquitous” (existing everywhere). Neither “salubrious” (healthful) or “comestible” (edible) fits the required meaning. For the second blank “were once the inevitable result of nutritional deficiencies,” diseases, or “maladies,” fits. Neither “reactions” nor “cultivars” (cultivated plants) would be “the inevitable result of nutritional deficiencies.” Finally, these once “inevitable” diseases are now mostly avoidable because people have better access to fresh produce. The best match is “preventable.” “Organic” and “dietetic” (relating to the diet) are both related to food but don’t match the meaning of avoidable.</p>

            <p>141. <b>Hardline, loath.</b> The sentence is tricky; you may need to fill the two blanks at the same time. Perhaps the senator is not willing to “strike a concessionary tone” or perhaps she is not reluctant to strike such a tone; which meaning is correct? “Concessionary” is the act of conceding a point, so the senator must have a particular position that differs from her opponents. If, in spite of her _________ position,” she is not reluctant to concede a point, then her position must be quite strong, or “hardline.” If, on the other hand, she is not willing to concede anything, then her position must be middle-of-the-road or undetermined. No choice fits this meaning, so “hardline” is the correct answer for the first blank. The sentence does not provide clues to tell whether her position is “conservative” or liberal. “Fiduciary,” (relating to trust, especially with financial matters) does not fit here. For the second blank, the senator was ultimately not unwilling, or not “loath” to concede a point. “Not permitted” would refer to someone else restricting her; the sentence doesn’t indicate this. “Not qualified” implies an outside value judgment; again, the sentence doesn’t indicate this.</p>

The second blank must be a word that is opposed to “health,” such as illness. “Infirmity” (weakness, frailty) is a match; neither “inattentiveness” (lack of attention) or “uncertainty” fits this meaning.

            <p>143. <b>Focused on, expanded, include.</b> The sentence contrasts early and later work in the field of spectroscopy: “early work” had something to do with “visible light,” while later work had something to do with “any and all interactions” of a certain type. The two blanks likely need to be filled together, so scan the answers. The options for the second blank are fairly similar: they all mean some form of broadened or changed. If the later work broadened or changed something for “any and all interactions,” then the earlier work must have been more narrow in scope. The best pairing is “focused on” and “expanded”: The early work “focused on” a more narrow area, while the later work “expanded” to “include” more interactions. For the first blank, “contrasted with” and “arose from” do not pair with the idea of broadened or changed to create a contrast between the first two blanks. For the second, “transformed” and “amended” both mean changed; “expanded” is a better match for the contrast with the first blank. Finally, “affirm” (assert, declare) and “endure” do not fit the full phrase: “the concept was expanded to affirm any and all interactions” or “the concept was expanded to endure any and all interactions.”</p>

            <p>139. <b>Cautious, conservative.</b> Gupta’s policies are “prudent,” meaning thoughtful, and “progressive,” while also “remaining _________ about imposing drastic social changes.” The word “while” indicates a contrast, so the party is likely being careful not to do anything drastic. Both “cautious” and “conservative” fit well. “Passionate” and “fervent” are a great pair, but the meaning is the opposite of what you want. “Congealed” (took shape or coalesced) does not match the required meaning and “concerned,” while tempting, does not have a pair among the answers.</p>

            <p>140. <b>Plodding, pedestrian.</b> That the economy expands at a certain pace is described as “a problem.” This happens when “wages of the middle class are stagnant,” showing no activity or only sluggishly growing. The blank, then, likely refers to a sluggish or slow pace of economic expansion. “Lucrative” and “profitable” are synonymous with each other, but imply economic growth, which would not be a problem. An “exponential” pace would be one that increases at a faster and faster rate, which is opposite the idea of “stagnant” wages or a “problem” with the economy. If the economy expands at a “normal” pace, the expansion is typical or expected, which is not negative enough. Only “plodding,“ which means slow-moving, and “pedestrian,” which means dull, fit the meaning of the sentence and produce sentences that are alike in meaning.</p>

            <p>141. <b>Profuse, prolific.</b> First, examine the structure of the sentence to determine the role of the blank. “The abilities of microorganisms to [do something] are more _________ than is commonly thought: from [X], to [Y], their innovative capabilities know no end.” The blank describes the “abilities.” The colon indicates that examples will follow of what is meant by the first part of the sentence. In the idiom “from X, to Y,” the examples X and Y are just two abilities, and the idiom suggests a range of other abilities in between. This is further supported by “their innovative capabilities know no end.” Thus, the blank should be a synonym for unlimited. The synonyms “profuse” and “prolific” mean abundant or plentiful, which fits the desired meaning. “Advantageous” and “beneficial” are synonyms meaning favorable or leading to good results. “Accommodating” forms something of a false triple with the previous pair: it means obliging someone else’s wishes and, like “beneficial,” is a synonym for helpful. Any of these could describe “abilities,” but none of the three address the meaning of the idiom or of capabilities that “know no end.” Finally, “ineffectual” means unproductive, so this choice is not only unpaired, it is also nearly opposite the intended meaning.</p>

            <p>142. <b>Atypical, anomalous.</b> In chess, a “gambit” is an opening move that sacrifices something (such as a pawn) in exchange for some other competitive advantage; such a move typically involves some risk. “Gambit” is also used outside of chess to mean a tactic or calculated move. (This is not the only chess term that can also be used figuratively: “pawn” is another.) Polgar has a “reputation for conservative,” or non-risky play, but lately she has been using a lot of “gambits.” The blank requires an adjective to describe these “gambits,” and might be filled with something like risky. “Treacherous” can mean deceitful or it can mean hazardous or risky, either of which could apply to “gambits” intended to take some advantage from an opponent. However, no other choice matches either definition. “Abstruse,” meaning difficult to understand, is not the same as risky. Polgar might be “studious” about determining which gambits to use, but “studious” is both out of context in the blank and unpaired. “Atypical” and “anomalous” both mean unusual or different from what is expected. This pair works because Polgar has a reputation for one type of play, but has been exhibiting another type. “Impractical” on its own is quite tempting, because “impractical” play seems almost opposite “conservative play,” but it does not have a match among the other choices and so cannot be correct.</p>

            <p>143. <b>Hobble, hamstring.</b> The politician who currently holds office would have to be deep in denial about the dissatisfaction of her constituency to to think that “pandering advertisements would do anything but _________ her campaign.” When a politician’s communications are described as “pandering,” it means that they are intended to please the group that they are trying to appeal to and are not sincere. A group that has been upset with a politician for a while is not likely to be impressed by this, so her campaign would likely be harmed by such advertisements. The correct answers, “hobble” and “hamstring,” literally mean to cripple the legs of an animal, and are used figuratively to mean to prevent the campaign from being able to take off. “Bolster,” which means to support or strengthen, “encourage,” and “restore” are almost opposites of the desired meaning and so are not correct. “Aggrieve” is tricky because it is negative, but it means to make resentful and so does not quite fit.</p>

The two answers that best match are “steadfast” and “unwavering,” which are synonyms meaning resolute or not wavering. “Vague” means uncertain or indefinite and “vacillating” means wavering or alternating between different options. These form an answer pair, but one that is the opposite of what the blank requires. “Apprehensive” is similar to, though not exactly a synonym of, “vague” or “vacillating”: someone who is fearful that something bad will happen might hesitate to make a decision, but not necessarily. “Critical” doesn’t directly address the question of decisiveness implied by the sentence, and has a negative connotation not supported by the sentence.</p>

The best pair of words, then, is “an obstacle to” and “a hurdle for,” suggesting that the errors prevented his (immediate) defeat. The other four options all give opposite meaning to this sentence, though in different degrees of certainty. “An insurance against” and “the guarantee of” would indicate that defeat was imminent, while “the reason for” and “an indication of” would suggest it was likely.</p>

            <p>147. <b>Generalizable, universal.</b> The colon in this sentence introduces an illustration of how or why the medical study is deficient. The study “assumes” one thing about the results, “however” something else is actually true. The blank, then, must contrast with “experimental participants were exclusively men between the ages of 30 and 60 with no significant co-morbidities.” It helps to know that “co-morbidities” are multiple diseases present simultaneously in a patient, but if you didn’t, the sentence provides enough other clues to answer correctly. The “glaring deficiency” is that the “experimental participants” included no females, no under-30- or over-60-year-olds, and no people with “significant co-morbidities.” In other words, the study was limited to a pretty specific group, so the contrasting blank should be something like “not limited.” Results that are “generalizable” can be broadly applied; “universal” results are applicable to all cases. These synonyms correctly allude to the study flaws that follow “however.” The adjective “positive” can mean a variety of things, including good, affirmative, optimistic, useful, or definite. When describing “results,” none of those meanings addresses the study flaws listed. A similar choice is “promising,” or showing signs of future success. While it would be wrong to assume that “results are promising” when the “study contains a glaring deficiency,” such an assumption is not itself an example of the deficiency. “Singular” and “exceptional” both mean remarkable or unusual—almost the opposite of “universal.”</p>

          <p>The story of <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> has its foundation in Arthurian legend asformulated and passed down by the pagan oral tradition. In its written form, however, thetale bears the marks of Christian influence—it contains numerous scriptural and doctrinalreferences to Christianity. Since the author of <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> is unknown, it is difficult to determine with any certainty the extent to which he was responsible forthe incorporation of Christianity into the legend. For all we know, the story may have been“Christianized” in its oral form long before the poet set it into writing. The poet himselfsupports this possibility by writing in the opening lines that he will tell “anew” the tale “as Iheard it in hall.” If this is the case (and even if it is not), it is distinctly possible that the heroes of the Arthurian tradition represent in the written form a pagan interpretation of Christian ideals,rather than an externally imposed Christianization of pagan codes of behavior. Christianity embodied by Sir Gawain, the poet is trying to correct what he sees to be the flawsof that form. From the perspective of this conclusion it is clear that the poet only “Christianizes”the traditional legend to the extent that he <i>criticizes</i> the pagan interpretation of Christianitythat is inherent in the behavior of its heroes. Christian hero would point to the descriptions of his chivalric qualities. The poet does indeeddescribe Gawain’s Christian virtues generously; he even makes a special aside early in thesecond fit to describe the significance of the pentangle embossed on Gawain’s shield, andto explain “why the pentangle is proper to that peerless prince.” The author then delves intoa lengthy enumeration of Gawain’s Christian virtues. What is more, the fact that he uses the pentangle—a pagan symbol—to do so would seem to suggest that the author does indeedintend to add a Christian interpretation to the pagan legend he is retelling. Viewed in itslarger context, however, this passage takes on a different significance. In further examinationof the poet’s descriptions of Sir Gawain, it becomes apparent that the knight’s seeminglyperfect Christian behavior is superficial. A contrast can be observed between his “Christian” words and actions and his decidedly un-Christian motives. One theory is that, by emphasizingthis contrast, the poet intends to denounce the pagan “misunderstanding” of the Christianmessage.</p>

          <p>Various tales in Herodotus’s <i>The Histories</i> display a circular means of the realization offate. In one story involving the birth of Cyrus and his rise to power in Asia, Herodotus tells usthat the Median king Astyages was having disturbing dreams about his daughter Mandane.We are told that his first dream, in which Mandane’s urine flooded all of Asia, was interpreted ominously by the Magi. As a consequence, when the time came to marry Mandane off,Astyages made what turned out to be a fatal mistake. While there were plenty of wealthy andpowerful Medes eligible for marriage, “his fear of the dream made him refuse to marry her toany of them; instead, he gave her to a Persian called Cambyses, whom he found to be of noblelineage and peaceful behavior, although he regarded him as the social inferior by far of a Mede of the middle rank.” Essentially, Astyages altered what would be a normal treatment of themarriage in order to marry his daughter to someone less threatening. This attempt to avoidthe prophesy of the first dream backfired however, and when Mandane became pregnant,Astyages had another foreboding dream. This second dream was interpreted to mean thatMandane’s son would rule in Astyages’s place. Herodotus tells us that “[the prophecy of the second dream] was what Astyages was guarding against” when he again took action, tellinghis advisor Harpagus to kill the baby. This plan backfired as well since Harpagus refused tokill the baby, leading to a complicated chain of events whereby the child—later to be namedCyrus—survived and returned to conquer his grandfather’s kingdom. In this story, Astyages’sdownfall is depicted as resulting directly from two major mistakes—marrying Mandane to Cambyses and telling Harpagus to kill their offspring. These mistakes in turn are shown to bemotivated by fear of the prophesies of his downfall. Had not some divine force planted thedreams in his head, he would not have taken the steps necessary to fulfill those prophesies.Through this circular path, destiny is unavoidably realized.</p>

          <p>Nineteenth century painter Albert Bierstadt’s view of his artistic skill as a vehicle forself-promotion was evident in his choices of style and subject matter. From the debut of hiscareer with the exhibition of <i>Lake Lucerne</i> (1856), he developed a fixed style that was mosteasily recognizable for its size—the largest of the 636 paintings on display at the exhibition, it was over three meters wide. This, coupled with the artist’s ability to represent the optimisticfeeling in America during the westward expansion, is what led to Bierstadt’s explosive growthin popularity during the 1860s. Bierstadt deliberately appealed to those rich patrons—railroadtycoons and financiers—whose nearest substitute to making the arduous journey out Westwas to purchase a hyperbolized replica of a Western vista. But trends following the Civil War produced a drastic shift away from the adventurousoptimism of the pre-war era and toward a more subdued appreciation for the details ofAmerican life. In this new social context, the paintings now seemed too decadent, too gaudy,for the new philosophy taking root in the country following the horrors of war. As onecommentator in 1866 put it, Bierstadt’s work “may impose upon the senses, but does not affect the heart.” In a sense, then, that same American pride upon which Bierstadt had capitalized toadvance his success was now, in its fickleness, the source of his downfall.</p>

            <p>(A) According to the argument, the decision revolves around the costs to consumers, not the number of channels available to them. If there were some pricing consequences as a result of this loss of diversity, the point might be relevant, but no such information is given.</p>
