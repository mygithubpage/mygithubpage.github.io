          <h3>Passage F: Sweet Spot</h3>
          <p>Though most tennis players generally strive to strike the ball on the racket’s vibration node, more commonly known as the “sweet spot,” many players are unaware of the existence of a second, lesser-known location on the racket face, the center of percussion, that will also greatly diminish the strain on a player’s arm when the ball is struck. </p>
          <p>In order to understand the physics of this second sweet spot, it is helpful to consider what would happen to a tennis racket in the moments after impact with the ball if the player’s hand were to vanish at the moment of impact. The impact of the ball would cause the racket to bounce backward, experiencing a translational motion away from the ball. The tendency of this motion would be to jerk all parts of the racket, including the end of its handle, backward, or away from the ball. Unless the ball happened to hit the racket precisely at the racket’s center of mass, the racket would additionally experience a rotational motion around its center of mass—much as a penny that has been struck near its edge will start to spin. Whenever the ball hits the racket face, the effect of this rotational motion will be to jerk the end of the handle forward, toward the ball. Depending on where the ball strikes the racket face, one or the other of these motions will predominate. </p>
          <p>However, there is one point of impact, known as the center of percussion, which causes neither motion to predominate; if a ball were to strike this point, the impact would not impart any motion to the end of the handle. The reason for this lack of motion is that the force on the upper part of the hand would be equal and opposite to the force on the lower part of the hand, resulting in no net force on the tennis player’s hand or forearm. The center of percussion constitutes a second sweet spot because a tennis player’s wrist typically is placed next to the end of the racket’s handle. When the player strikes the ball at the center of percussion, her wrist is jerked neither forward nor backward, and she experiences a relatively smooth, comfortable tennis stroke.</p>
          <p>The manner in which a tennis player can detect the center of percussion on a given tennis racket follows from the nature of this second sweet spot. The center of percussion can be located via simple trial and error by holding the end of a tennis racket between your finger and thumb and throwing a ball onto the strings. If the handle jumps out of your hand, then the ball has missed the center of percussion.</p>

                <b>CORRECT.</b> False. This choice contradicts information given in the first paragraph: the center of percussion is only one of two sweet spots that minimize vibration. The vibration node is the other sweet spot.</li>
              <li>True. The first paragraph introduces the concept that the impact can “strain” the player’s arm.</li>
              <li>True. The second paragraph describes at least two different forces that act upon a tennis racket striking the ball: “translational,” as described in the second and third sentences, and “rotational,” as described in the fourth and fifth sentences.</li>
              <li>True. The fourth sentence of the second paragraph states that “unless the ball happened to hit the racket precisely at the racket’s center of mass, the racket would additionally experience a rotational motion.” The fifth sentence then reads: “Whenever the ball hits the racket face, the effect of this rotational motion will be to jerk the end of the handle forward, toward the ball.”</li>
              <li>True. The second sentence of the second paragraph states that a racket will “bounce backward” after striking the ball; these words are synonyms for <i>rebound.</i></li>

            <p>The passage says that “the racket would additionally experience a rotational motion around its center of mass—much as a penny that has been struck near its edge will start to spin.” In other words, the motion of the penny is an example that closely mimics the situation with the tennis racket. The correct answer should match this characterization. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The center of mass does not cause the racket to spin; rather, a ball striking the racket causes it to spin.</li>
              <li>The author does not present the information about the penny as an argument; rather, it is an example.

            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The passage does explain that holding the racket at the end of the handle and hitting the ball at a particular spot results in a comfortable stroke that reduces the strain on a player’s arm. It does not address, however, what would happen if the player grasped the racket at a different point. It is possible that grasping the racket at another point would simply result in a different center of percussion.</li>
              <li>The passage states that there is one commonly known sweet spot and a second, lesser-known sweet spot. However, the passage says nothing about the relative efficacy of these two sweet spots.</li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT. </b>You are told that playing tennis can result in strain on a player’s arm. You are also told that striking the ball at the center of percussion leads to a “smooth, comfortable stroke,” or one which does not cause the same kind of damage as a regular stroke. Striking the ball at a spot other than the center of percussion, then, could lead to a jarring stroke, or one that could cause damage to a player’s arm.</li>
              <li>The passage mentions nothing about “tennis elbow” or what behavior can result in this injury; it merely talks about “strain.” Be careful not to add additional information beyond what is presented in the passage.</li>
              <li>The second paragraph obliquely addresses a situation in which a tennis player lets go of the racket at the moment of impact. However, this question does not specify the point at which the tennis ball struck the racket. If the ball did not strike a sweet spot, the racket may have some translational or rotational force transferred from the ball and so might not drop straight to the ground.</li>

            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b>
            </p>
            <p>Two things have already occurred: the U.S. government has restricted stem cell research for companies in the United States. As a result, U.S.-based scientists in this field have chosen to work instead for foreign-based companies.

              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> If U.S.-based scientists signed contracts with foreign-based companies <i>specifically because</i> of government restrictions in the United States, then the new companies with which these scientists signed must operate under fewer restrictions. Therefore, at least some foreign companies must work under fewer restrictions than some American companies do. </li>
              <li> Under the current terms, stem cell research is restricted for everybody in the United States, so foreign professionals in this field would not necessarily want to come to the United States. While it is possible that once the restrictions are lifted, American companies will want to hire more scientists and will seek them overseas, the government has only proposed to lift the restrictions; it hasn’t actually done so.</li>
              <li> This passage is about government restrictions in the United States; financial backing in particular is out of the scope of the argument.</li>
              <li> You are not given any information regarding America’s current or future position in terms of stem cell research. Though government restrictions and scientists switching companies could be issues related to a company’s prosperity, you are given no information about how these directly affect America’s position. </li>

            <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b>
            </p>
            <p>The words “weaken” and “if true” indicate that this is a Weaken the Conclusion question. Look for the conclusion made by the “educational experts.”</p>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b>
            </p>
            <p>The argument is concerned with how public school teachers are compensated. According to the argument, educational experts claim that a system of teacher compensation based on performance rather than seniority would help to retain exceptional teachers and maintain quality instruction. </p>
            <p>What are the experts assuming? Can “performance” actually be measured in a meaningful way? Should it be based on how much the students like the teacher? A fun but incompetent teacher might be beloved by students. A challenging teacher might receive lower teacher ratings even though his students learn more.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: State the Goal</b>
            </p>
            <p>The correct answer to this Weaken question will make the experts’ conclusion at least a little less likely to be valid.</p>
            <p><b>Step 4: Work from Wrong to Right</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Slash. The fact that other factors also contribute to job satisfaction and teaching performance neither weakens nor strengthens this argument. Either way, the teachers are getting paid; the issue is whether that pay should be based on performance or seniority. </li>
              <li> Slash. Nothing in the argument indicates that one universal system of compensation must be adopted in order to implement this plan. It is very possible that several effective models of performance-based pay could be developed and implemented successfully. </li>
              <li> Strengthen. This choice indicates that many young, effective teachers are extremely frustrated by the traditional pay structure, in which financial advancement is directly tied to seniority. This bolsters the experts’ argument: these young but effective teachers who are leaving the profession might stay longer if they had better opportunity for advancement based on performance. </li>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> Weaken. This choice indicates that collaboration among teachers is integral to high-quality instruction and that a system of compensation based on teacher performance reduces collaboration. Thus, the effect of a merit-based system of pay might undermine quality instruction, which is one of the two stated goals of the educational experts. </li>
              <li> Strengthen. The educational experts’ argument in favor of performance-based compensation is bolstered if standardized test scores have dramatically risen in school districts that have instituted such pay structures.</li>

        <div id="passage3" class="passage">
          <p> Traditionally, public school instructors have been compensated according to seniority.

            <p><b>Flagitious, antediluvian, allegories.</b>The first blank gives you a “stark contrast” with the Greek representation of these times as a Golden Age, so it should be something bad, even starkly bad. <i>Dubious</i> (warranting uncertainty or doubt) doesn’t necessarily mean bad, and <i>rustic</i> (rural; lacking refinement) isn’t anywhere near as negative as <i>flagitious</i>, which means “marked by vice.” The ancient Greek myths are about the distant or remote past. <i>Antediluvian</i> is the correct fit (don’t be misled into thinking of <i>antediluvian</i> as a trap—it does literally mean “before the flood,” and thus doesn’t apply to the Greek myths, but it also means “extremely ancient,” which is what you’re looking for). The stories about the past—in the third blank—would be <i>equivocations</i> if each of them contained a mixed message; but instead it looks like the mix comes only if you are comparing Biblical with Greek stories. <i>Allegories</i>, or stories with a moral or political meaning, are the right contrast for “faithful attempts at reconstruction” and correctly match “expressing ... fears and hopes.” <i>Platitudes</i> (dull, trite statements or remarks) introduces a connotation of banality not indicated by the text.</p>

When <i>exclusive</i> is used to describe a commodity, it means “not obtainable elsewhere” and is generally used in a positive sense. Out of concern, Francis “reduced himself … through new wardrobe acquisitions.” It sounds like Francis spent a lot of money on clothes—spending a lot of money could reduce someone—especially someone with <i>georgic </i>means—to near poverty (<i>penury</i>). <i>Malaise</i> (vague, general sense of unease or mental discomfort ) and <i>lethargy</i> (state of sluggishness, inactivity, laziness, or indifference ) are near-synonyms, and neither follows from the proof in the sentence. The executive to whom he devoted his attentions, on the other hand, was concealing “her financial ruin.” But how did she ruin herself? Given that she was nattily dressed, she probably also spent her money on clothes. <i>Sartorial</i> means “relating to clothes or style,” so it fits the third blank perfectly. <i>Bombastic</i> (pompous, pretentious) and <i>runic</i> (mysterious) both add meaning that isn’t indicated by any clues.</p>

            <p> The sentence indicates that “Even” major campaign finance reform will “fail” to do something to “the influence of money.” This money “directly relates” to a politician being able to become a politician, so the influence of money must be pretty strong.

Don’t confuse the verb <i>graft</i> with the noun <i>graft</i>, which means “acquisition of money (or other valuable) in dishonest or questionable ways” and represents a theme trap here.</p>
