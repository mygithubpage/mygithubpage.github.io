          <h3>Passage E: Polygamy</h3>
          <p>Polygamy in Africa has been a popular topic for social research over the past half-century; it has been analyzed by many distinguished minds and in various well-publicized works. In 1961, when Remi Clignet published his book <i>Many Wives, Many Powers</i>, he was not alone in sharing the view that in Africa co-wives may be perceived as direct and indirect sources of increased income and prestige. For instance, some observers argued that polygamous marriages are more able than monogamous marriages to produce many children, who can legitimately be seen as a form of wealth as well as of “this-world” immortality connected to the transmission of family names (as opposed to “other-world” immortality in an afterlife). Moreover, polygamy is rooted in and sanctioned by many ancient traditions, both cultural and religious; therefore, some assert that polygamy can provide a stabilizing function within societies frequently under stress from both internal and external forces.</p>
          <p>By the 1970s, such arguments had become crystallized and popular. Many other African scholars who wrote on the subject became the new champions of this philosophy. For example, in 1983, John Mbiti proclaimed that polygamy is an accepted and respectable institution serving many useful social purposes. Similarly, G.K. Nukunya, in his paper “Polygamy as a Symbol of Status,” reiterated Mbiti’s idea that a plurality of wives is a legitimate sign of affluence and power in African society.</p>
          <p>However, the colonial missionary voice provided consistent opposition to polygamy by viewing the practice as unethical and destructive of family life. While the missionaries propagated this view citing the authority of the Bible, they were convinced that Africans had to be coerced into partaking in the vision of monogamy understood by the Western culture. The missionary viewpoint even included, in some instances, dictating immediate divorce in the case of newly converted men who had already contracted polygamous marriages. Unfortunately, both the missionary voice and the scholarly voice did not consider the views of African women important. Although there was some awareness that women regarded polygamy as both a curse and a blessing, the distanced, albeit scientific, perspective of an outside observer predominated both on the pulpit and in scholarly writings.</p>
          <p>Contemporary research in the social sciences has begun to focus on the protagonist’s voice in the study of culture, recognizing that the views and experiences of those who take part in a given reality ought to receive close examination. This privileging of the protagonist seems appropriate, particularly given that women in Africa have often used literary productions, which feature protagonists and other “actors” undergoing ordeals and otherwise taking active part in real life, to comment on marriage, family, and gender relations.</p>

            <p>On this type of question, it is helpful to reread the topic sentence of the paragraph at issue. The topic sentence is typically in the first or second sentence of the paragraph.

                <b>CORRECT.</b> The third paragraph describes the position of the colonial missionary and indicates a flaw in this perspective. The missionary’s position is described in the opening sentence of the paragraph: “However, the colonial missionary voice provided consistent opposition to polygamy by viewing the practice as unethical and destructive of family life.” Furthermore, after ­discussing this position, the author goes on to identify a deficiency in this reasoning: “Unfortunately, both the missionary voice and the scholarly voice did not consider the views of African women important.”</li>

                <b>CORRECT.</b> This statement is explicitly supported by the penultimate sentence of the third paragraph: “Unfortunately, both the missionary voice and the scholarly voice did not consider the views of African women important.”</li>
              <li>While the passage suggests that the colonial missionary may have attempted to limit the prevalence of polygamy by coercing Africans “into partaking in the vision of monogamy,” nothing in the passage suggests that the scholarly research shared this perspective.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>CORRECT.</b> The second paragraph states that Nukunya’s work “Polygamy as a Symbol of Status” “reiterated Mbiti’s idea that a plurality of wives is a legitimate sign of affluence and power.” Since Nukunya’s work reiterated the views of Mbiti, “Polygamy as a Symbol of Status” must have been written <i>after</i> Mbiti expressed his perspective on polygamy. According to the text, it was not until 1983 that “John Mbiti proclaimed that polygamy is an accepted and respectable institution.” Therefore, Nukunya’s “Polygamy as a Symbol of Status” must have been written in 1983 or later; you can conclude that it was not written in 1981.</li>
              <li>While the text mentions that contemporary research acknowledges that the perspective of African women should receive closer attention, nothing in the passage suggests that Mbiti ­subsequently embraced this view and changed his initial stance.</li>
              <li>In the second sentence of the opening paragraph, the author states that “when Remi Clignet ­published his book <i>Many Wives, Many Powers</i>, he was not alone in sharing the view…” suggesting that at the time of publication, other scholars viewed polygamy as a symbol of prestige and wealth. Therefore, Clignet’s book may not have been the first to give this perspective.</li>
              <li>While the passage mentions that the colonial missionary opposed polygamy, viewing it as “unethical and destructive,” nothing in the passage suggests that polygamy was declared illegal in Africa.</li>
              <li>The passage does say that many African scholars in this era championed polygamy, but the passage does not indicate whether these scholars represented “a large proportion” of all of the “scholars writing on polygamy.”</li>

            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b>
            </p>
            <p>The conclusion is located in the question stem: The Gold Standard shoe line will be profitable. The passage states only that the costs of manufacturing this shoe are exceptionally high. Profit equals revenue minus cost. If costs are exceptionally high, the only way a profit can be made is if revenue is also exceptionally high. </p>
            <p><b>Step 3: State the Goal</b>
            </p>
            <p>Find an answer that makes the conclusion at least a little more likely to be valid. Keep an eye out for information about revenue, as that may be the assumption that is addressed in the correct answer.</p>
            <p><b>Step 4: Work from Wrong to Right</b>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <b> CORRECT.</b> Strengthen. If some potential customers are willing to pay exceptionally high prices, then the exceptionally high costs might be offset enough for the shoe line to be profitable. (Note that this answer doesn’t indicate that the new shoe line definitely will be profitable, only that it is a little more likely to be.)</li>
              <li> Slash. A higher sales rate than projected does not actually give you any information about profitability. In any case, the results of past releases are not necessarily indicative of the case at hand.</li>
              <li> Slash. One can argue that this is good for Brand X, in that it will mean that there is one less competitor, or that this is bad for Brand X, in that it is indicative of a sagging sneaker market. In any case, there is no direct connection between this rival brand and the potential profitability of The Gold Standard.</li>
              <li> Slash. You have been told nothing that connects the market to profitability. The size of the market does not necessarily have any bearing on profitability.</li>
              <li> Slash/Weaken. This is perhaps one reason why manufacturing costs are so high, but you already knew the costs were high from the argument. If anything, this piece of information weakens the conclusion by providing more information about the high costs.</li>

                <b>CORRECT.</b> If the sales personnel at CarStore have historically specialized in aggressive sales tactics and promoting add-on features, but CarStore wants to move to a less aggressive approach, then the sales team will need to learn new sales tactics.

In the first part of the sentence, the protests are “uncompromising.” Thus, in the second part, they should be softer, more on the side of compromising.

            <p><i>Clement </i>and <i>merciful</i> are an incorrect synonym pair. They both go against the spin that the blank calls for. <i>Delimited</i> (having limits established; bounded) and <i>tantamount</i> (equivalent; virtually the same as) are not related.</p>

            <p><i>Inane</i> and <i>fatuous</i> are an incorrect pair, both meaning “silly.” While the “premise of impartiality” may not in fact exist, that doesn’t make it silly. <i>Prejudicial</i> (harmful; detrimental) and <i>vexing</i> (irksome; irritating) have no relationship.</p>
