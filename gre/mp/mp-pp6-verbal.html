            <p>31. <b>Ephemeral, heralded.</b> Since the government lasted only about two months, it was “ephemeral,” or short-lived. “Equivocal,” or ambiguous, and “omnipotent,” or all powerful, could describe a government, but this sentence gives no such indication of either of these meanings. Despite the fact that it was short-lived, the government was regarded, or celebrated, as the emergence of a powerful working class: only “heralded” matches. The expression “discounted as X” might work if the final part of the sentence held a more negative tone: the idea was discounted as too impractical. But “the emergence of a powerful working class” has no such negative connotation. Similarly, “recanted,” or renounced, would only work if the final part of the sentence was something that was being disavowed.</p>

            <p>32. <b>Complications, stouter, a concomitant.</b> The first sentence says that taller turbines would be better, but there is some contrasting negative element. In other words, the “engineers are facing” some “complications.” Neither “flaws” nor “supplements” conveys this idea of difficulty in building the turbines. In the second sentence, “Taller towers necessitate _________ bases, requiring the current width to be nearly doubled,” suggests that the second blank should mean wider. The only choice for the second blank that can mean “wider” is “stouter.” “Equitable,” meaning fair, and “unobtrusive” do not mean anything like “wider.” The final sentence says that the wider sections lead “to a(an) _________ issue” because they are too large to transport on modern highways. Therefore, the third blank has to mean something like additional. Although “a theoretical issue” has a nice sound to it, the problem is very real, so “theoretical” cannot be correct. “Objective” used as an adjective means unbiased, which does not fit the intended meaning. “Concomitant,” which means accompanying (often in a subordinate way), matches well.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>33. <b>Obsequious.</b> “Plaudits” are praise (note the similarity to “applause”), which matches the idea of praise being “heaped upon him” on a “prolonged and elaborate farewell tour.” Additionally, the negative certainty of “<i>no one</i> thought the plaudits heaped upon him were _________” matches in degree the positive certainty of “admired <i>by all</i>” If he was admired by all, then no one would think that the praise was undeserved or inappropriate. Thus, “deserved” represents a reversal trap. “Obsequious,” meaning attentive to an excessive degree, puts a negative spin on the praise, which is what “no one” would think; this is the answer. “Derivative” as an adjective has several meanings, depending on what it is describing: it is typically applied to people or the works of art they produce (imitative) or can apply to a financial product (having a value based on some asset). Here, “derivative” describes “plaudits,” so it most likely means originating from or based on something. Because the blank is not getting at whether the praise is original, but rather whether it is appropriate, this choice is incorrect. Both “vestigial,” residual or leftover, and “antiquated,” old-fashioned or outdated, introduce additional meaning not indicated by the sentence.</p>

            <p>34. <b>Sanguine, peccadilloes.</b> The sentence states that the man’s personality is pleasing—so pleasing that “it’s hard to be bothered by” something in his past. The first word should match pleasing, and the second should be something negative that others might overlook. “Sanguine” means cheerful and optimistic. Note that “high-handed” might sound positive, but actually means tactlessly overbearing. “Evanescent” (fading quickly, short-lived) is inappropriate to describe a personality. “Peccadilloes” are minor faults or sins—small enough that they might be overlooked if the person has other virtues. “Incendiaries” can mean either bombs or a person who stirs up conflict; the former definition is too strong for the blank, and the latter does not fit the meaning of the sentence. “Achievements” has a positive connotation, while the second blank should convey a negative connotation.</p>

            <p>35. <b>Menacing, unprovoked.</b> The Tasmanian devil, a type of wild animal, is “not considered _________ since only a few of its confrontations,” or hostile encounters, “with humans have been _________.” The two blanks have to work together in this sentence, and the second blank is easier. “Unprovoked” is the only choice for the second blank that would reasonably describe hostile encounters with wild animals “Quixotic,” which means idealistic or unrealistic, does not work because the sentence is talking about real encounters. “Premature” does not fit either. Given that the Tasmanian devil usually only confronts humans when provoked, it is not “menacing,” which is the correct choice for blank (i). Because it is a wild animal, it cannot be considered predictable, so “unpredictable” is incorrect. “Adverse,” which is used to describe something that is harmful because it prevents success, is inappropriate to use in describing a wild animal. You might say that the presence of wild animals is an “adverse” factor, but you could not say that the animals themselves were “adverse.”</p>

            <p>36. <b>Verdant, castigated.</b> The sentence indicates that the employee is young and makes mistakes. “Verdant” means either green and lush, like a forest, or new and inexperienced (the use of green as a metaphor, as in, she’s still green at her job). “Banal” means unoriginal, which does not fit with the rest of the sentence, and “sagacious” means shrewd, which is the opposite of how the employee acted. Since the mistake was so expensive, it makes sense that the employee would be “castigated,” or severely criticized. He wouldn’t be “deposed”—that word is for kings, dictators, etc., forced out of power. And the employee would not be “enamored,” or filled with a feeling of love, for the mistake he just made.</p>

These are correct answers. “Dull” and “lackluster” are the opposites of the desired meaning. “Poignant” (touching in a sad way) also does not mean happy or lively. “Benign” can mean kindly, but has no connotation of joyous or lively and so does not fit.</p>

The sentence indicates, however, that the system’s fairness is “not currently in dispute” at that level, so the blank requires synonyms for fairness or impartiality. The correct answers are “equity” and “probity” (integrity, honesty). The words “unfairness” and “partiality,” which means favoritism, are opposite the desired meaning. “Solemnity,” which describes a serious and proper state of being, and “solicitousness,” which means hovering attentiveness, are not correct because they do not fit the desired meaning and do not have a match.</p>

An iconoclast is someone who attacks beliefs or institutions that are widely accepted, so a predictable response to a “provocative proposal” would not be described as “iconoclastic.” “Inscrutable” and “impenetrable” both mean impossible to understand, but, since the criticism here was unconcealed, these don’t work. “Fictitious” cannot be correct, because there is nothing to suggest that the response was imaginary, although the authors might have wished that it were.</p>

            <p>34. <b>Arduous, onerous</b> The prime minister “affected empathy for the impoverished citizenry,” meaning that she acted as if she understood and shared the emotions of the poor citizens. However, the word “but” after the comma changes the direction, suggesting that she didn’t actually feel that way. The sentence goes on to say that most historians think that her “austerity measures,” meaning cost-saving measures, further harmed the poor citizens. The measures are described as “unduly _________,” so the blank must be filled by something that an empathetic person would not impose on citizens struggling with poverty. The correct answers are “arduous” and “onerous,” which both mean overly difficult or unpleasant. “Strict” is almost a match, but strict is used to describe rules that must be obeyed, not rules that are overly harsh. “Commercial” and “mercantilist” form a pair that means having to do with the buying and selling of goods and services, but this is a trap because the sentence talks about “economic historians.” “Venal” is an excellent GRE word that means capable of being bought or bribed, but does not work here.</p>

          <p>Henri Matisse’s <i>The Ochre Head</i> represents the artist’s exuberant display of his newmastery of a technique once peculiar to Picasso. Matisse has learned to artfully separatecolor and drawing. The painting depicts a head and shoulders, a bouquet of red flowers in adark blue vase sitting upon a bench, a framed drawing of a woman’s head, and an unframed painting or drawing, also of a woman. But what is most striking about the painting is theway Matisse has begun to allow his colors and his forms to play freely, even while they arecoordinated. The ochre of the head runs out past the form. Bits of blue from the bench appearin the man’s neckline or along his shoulder. The colors of the various frames and surfaces of thedrawing on the wall overlap and refuse to be constrained by definite lines of form. Although this technique is not given the kind of free reign Picasso allows it in his Cubist period or inworks such as <i>Minotaur</i>, it is still a stunning development for Matisse. And he seems aware ofthis fact. The painting’s composition references Picasso’s <i>Still Life with Ancient Head</i> from 1925,signaling Matisse’s awareness that he is borrowing from his younger colleague.</p>

          <p>History textbooks in the United States are far too fact-based and even have the abilityto make students feel as though all history is made up of “Quick-Facts” and diagrams, notdynamic events to be critically analyzed. Furthermore, it is often the case that textbooks aregiven undue authority in determining the curriculum; many teachers simply “teach the book.” This is particularly disturbing when considering the fact that state committees forchoosing textbooks often treat them, in the words of Sandra Wong, “more like encyclopediasof facts than as cultural products that convey values and perspectives” when decidingwhich ones to pick. In her article “Evaluating the Content of Textbooks: Public Interests andProfessional Authority,” Wong discusses how textbook committees are rarely concerned with the actual substance of the writing in the textbooks they evaluate, and are far more interestedin things like “charts, illustrations, and introductory outlines.” listening to music, using interactive online resources, elucidating connections to students’personal lives by going to local history museums or having students write autobiographicalessays, etc.—the most promising is, by far, film. Movies are a magnificent way into history foreven the most resistant naysayer of historical study. Film is a hugely popular medium withendless numbers of historically based works—everything from documentaries to dramas—that not only present facts, but dramatize the human relations behind those facts. does it allow students to see history come to life, and thus interact with it dynamically, as wellas make history immediately accessible to a modern audience because of the techniques usedin filmmaking, but it can also foster deep critical thinking skills if instructors lead dialoguesafter film viewings about the inaccuracies, the biases, and all of the things that make the filmnot just a record of a historical event, but also a reflection of the modern moment.</p>

Thus, the author certainly argues that students can benefit from exposure to inaccurate accounts of history (not that students would <i>always</i> benefit, but that students <i>can</i> benefit when the inaccurate film is accompanied by critical analysis). The other choices cannot be justified. Choice (B) does not have to follow; the passage only lists music and film as alternatives. Choice (C) is too extreme.

            <p>13. <b>(D).</b> The conclusion of the argument is that one need not worry about ingesting pesticides when purchasing produce from farms that use only organic pesticides. The basis for that claim is that organic pesticides leave the surface of produce within a few hours of spraying. In order for this argument to be valid, one must assume that the organic pesticides do not harm the produce in any lasting way and that people aren’t eating the produce within a few hours of the pesticide treatment.</p>
            <p>(A) This is unrelated to the argument, since the conclusion speaks about not having to worry about ingesting produce on which only organic pesticides were known to be used.</p>
            <p>(B) If anything, this statement runs counter to the argument. If produce that has been sprayed with organic pesticide reaches the final consumer within hours, it is possible that the pesticides are still present.</p>
            <p>(C) The conclusion of the argument is already limited to those farms that use “only organic pesticides.”</p>
            <p><b>(D) CORRECT.</b> If a pesticide is capable of penetrating the skin of a fruit or vegetable then, while the organic pesticide will dissipate from the surface of the fruit in a few hours, it might remain inside the fruit. The author of this argument assumes that the organic pesticides cannot penetrate the skin.</p>

          <p> Inorganic pesticides remain active on the surfaces of fruits and vegetables for several days after spraying, while organic pesticides dissipate within a few hours after application, leaving the surface of the sprayed produce free of pesticide residue. Therefore, when purchasing from a farm that uses inorganic pesticides, one must be careful to wash the produce thoroughly before eating it to prevent the ingestion of toxins. But one need not worry about ingesting pesticides when purchasing from farms that use only organic pesticides.</p>

            <p>(A) The fact that schools educate middle school students about a disease that is generally “acquired later in life” does not address the effectiveness of a broad public education plan sponsored by the government.</p>
            <p>(B) The fact that the public already has access to this information through the internet does not say anything predictive about the effectiveness of the plan. People may not actually be reading the information.</p>
