          <div class="explanation" data-answer="E">
            <p>1. <b>Apportioned.</b> You are told that football is by far the most popular sport in Europe. The word “whereas” then creates a contrast: the U.S. fans are evenly split among their many sports. “Regarded,” “inspired,” and “enjoyed” are all traps related to sports or fandom, but don’t properly express the sentence’s intention that the popularity is split. “Measured” is close, but doesn’t quite divide things appropriately. “Apportioned” means divided and allocated; it is the correct answer.</p>

            <p>2. <b>Delusion.</b> The second half of the sentence states that it would take a miracle for a person to get to another solar system. In other words, it’s more or less impossible. “Dementia,” “catastrophe,” and “hysteria” do not reflect this meaning. And while space travel would be an incredible “innovation,” innovation also doesn’t express the proper meaning of this sentence. “Delusion,” meaning a belief that is maintained despite being contradicted by reality, is the best fit.</p>

In the second blank, “deified” has a positive tone and doesn’t express the contrast that the sentence suggests, while “demonized” is much too strong an attitude to direct towards someone for lacking education; “dismissed” is a more appropriate word and the correct answer.</p>

            <p>4. <b>Abridged, complementary.</b> Certain “versions of novels and essays” cut out important parts, or “excise essential elements.” Then, “to fully understand the intent of the original,” students would have to “supplement,” or add to, “their reading with [some type of] sources.” So the text versions described by blank (i) are lacking parts of the original and the reading sources described by blank (ii) provide some of what is lacking. An “abridged” source is one that has been shortened, and “complementary sources” would enhance or support this shortened version. Be careful of the homophone “complimentary,” which means either admiring or given free of charge, neither of which works in blank (ii). “Compelling” sources would either evoke interest or inspire conviction. While the supplemental reading might do so, no indication of either additional meaning is given in the sentence, and this choice fails to address the problem that “abridged versions” create for students. “Annotated versions” have additional notes of explanation; such versions would be <i>less</i> likely to require supplementation to understand, not more. Finally, there is no indication that the “[blank (i)] versions of novels and essays” are “antedated,” or dated prior to their actual date.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="B">
            <p>5. <b>Sophisticated.</b> The blank should be a positive word to accompany “alluring.” What’s more, it should be something that contrasts the “simple and quaint” nature of rural America. Given this, you need a positive word for something not simple. “Lascivious” means overtly and often inappropriately sexual; this doesn’t fit the sentence. “Foreign” may appear to go along with “expatriate;” it’s easy to fall into such a theme trap if you are not in the habit of pointing to explicit clues in the sentence (“simple and quaint,” in this case). “Alien” is similar in meaning to “foreign” and is also a slightly negative word. Likewise, “alienating” is not a positive word—in this case, it would lead to an impression that the young lad felt unwelcome in Paris. “Sophisticated,” with its sense of polished culture, offers the best contrast to “simple and quaint.”</p>

            <p>6. <b>Cited, correct.</b> The first sentence states a fact about life expectancy that relates to the claim that the world is improving with time. Clearly this would be true if life expectancies have increased with time, making “cited” a perfect fit for blank (i). Neither “disregarded” nor “embodied” fits with the idiom “as evidence.” The second blank, however, says that this statistic is slightly misleading if one considers a second fact (i.e., that most children died in childbirth). While you might “prepare” for the fact or “read” for the fact, that does not change the fact. But if you “correct” for the fact that most children died in childbirth, then the new life expectancy statistic would change.</p>

            <p>1. <b>Steward, husband.</b> The “While” indicates that the second part of the sentence will contrast with pushing forward—due to the approaching winter, the colonists need to stay put and conserve what they have. Only “steward” and “husband” mean this. “Sell” and “peddle” don’t work because there’s nothing in the sentence to indicate that they need to sell or buy anything. (And why would you sell your resources when a hard winter is coming?) “Procure,” which means get or acquire, doesn’t work because the sentence references their “existing resources.” “Upend” also doesn’t work because of its meaning; the colonists do not need to stand their resources on end!</p>

            <p>2. <b>See, distinguish.</b> This sentence is worded in a tricky way, as the words “but” and “barely” negate each other. Thus, the blank parallels “saw deeply.” (“Proof” here means proofread or edit, and galleys are drafts of a book about to be published.) How ironic that an author who sees into the hearts of his characters is practically blind in real life! “Interpret” is an attractive trap, but Joyce had a vision problem, not an intellectual one. “Feel,” “walk,” and “move” are not correct because they don’t mean to see.</p>

            <p>3. <b>Capricious, fickle.</b> The first part of the sentence describes a woman as “less _________” at work “than she is around her friends,” “but” her staff at work occasionally does see her “in a volatile state,” or a temperamental state that is likely to change quickly. Given the “but,” the blank must be a synonym for “volatile.” “Capricious” and “fickle” can both mean temperamental and likely to change quickly and so are the correct answers. Although “direct” and “explicit” form a pair, they are not synonyms for “volatile” and so are not correct. “Informal” and “pretentious” also do not fit “volatile.”</p>

Ultimately, the view is balanced, or “nuanced,” so choice (C) is correct. Regarding choice (A), the author does not “propose changes.” Regarding (B), the author never argues that any group of college students should (or should not) form their own companies. If anything, the author offers both sides of the issue, leaving it up to individuals to decide. Regarding (D), the author offers one fact about the varying rates at which businesses of two types (low value and high value) are founded. However, the author never evaluates the viability (or likelihood of success) of these types. As for (E), the analogy drawn in the last two sentences is not the main point of the passage; it is a final observation, one that sheds light on the issue, but this analogy is not the primary purpose for which the passage was written.</p>

          <p>While new census data reveals that unemployment numbers are more dire than waspreviously suspected, it is not clear that the forecast for American entrepreneurship is equallyalarming. An article in a major national newspaper suggests that the contraction in hiring atexisting companies might result in more new companies being founded. College graduates, unable to find traditional jobs, instead opt to start their own businesses. Where a recession mayseem an unpropitious time for such a historically risky endeavor, with no better options, would-beentrepreneurs have little to lose. Unfortunately, this situation does not necessarily impactthe economy positively. Though the average number of new businesses started per year hasbeen higher during the recession than it was before, the proportion of high-value businesses founded each year has declined. So even if a business manages to stay solvent, it may notbring significant returns. Also, because of an inevitable dearth of angel investors and venturecapitalists, many new entrepreneurs are putting their own money on the line. In certain ways,the choice between accepting a traditional job and starting a business is not unlike the choicebetween renting and buying property. The latter requires a significant initial outlay and carries heavier risks, but the rewards can be equally substantial.</p>

Specifically: “College graduates, unable to find traditional jobs, instead opt to start their own businesses,” (lines 4–5). Correct choice (B) matches the idea that college graduates are “unable to find traditional jobs.” Regarding (A), college graduates who start their own businesses may indeed be hampered by a lack of access to outside investment, but this is not offered as the reason that they start such businesses. Be careful of answer choices that restate truths from the passage but do not answer the specific question posed! As for (C), it may be true that low-value companies have become more prevalent, but again, this does not answer the specific question.

The answer choices all have to do with how this number has changed (or may have changed) during the course of the recent recession. In particular, when you encounter mathematical language, take extra care to make the argument airtight mathematically. Search for the key phrase “high-value businesses”: the passage states that “the proportion of high-value businesses founded each year has declined.” Watch out! A proportion is not the same as a number. The proportion has fallen, but the overall number of new business starts has been higher over recent years. If the overall number is up, but the proportion is down, it is unknown whether the absolute number of high-value businesses is up or down; this is exactly what choice (E) indicates.</p>

            <p>4. <b>(C).</b> The passage states that some women went to war to nurse others or to provide supplies and that “such women,” including many old women, died in battle. Therefore, it can be inferred that “some of those who worked as nurses or in providing supplies died in battle,” which makes choice (C) correct. Regarding choice (A), the passage does not address how people lamented the deaths of anyone who died in battle. The passage also does not address the courageousness of younger women, choice (B), or the status of men in Asante culture, choices (D) and (E).</p>

            <p>5. <b>(E).</b> The first paragraph introduces bacterial “super-bugs” with some alarm. The second paragraph increases the alarm, noting that “many scientists argue that the human race has more to fear from viruses.” This paragraph describes how viruses hijack the cell in order to illustrate how tough viruses are to treat. The last paragraph continues the comparison and puts a stake in the ground: “bacteria lack the potential for cataclysm that viruses have.” The point is further illustrated by the “near-miss” of the HIV pandemic. As for choice (A), it is unknown how bacteria</p>
            <p>infect the body. Regarding (B), the hijacking process is certainly described, but to make a larger point: why it’s hard to eradicate viruses in comparison with bacteria. As for (C), after reading this passage, you may want to call up the CDC and donate money, but the passage itself only raises a warning, if even that—it is not a call to action. Regarding choice (D), the last paragraph does highlight the human race’s good fortune, but this is not the larger point of the whole passage. Choice (E) is correct—the passage compares the two threats (bacteria and viruses) and judges viruses to be far more important (after all, viruses have the “potential for cataclysm”).</p>

          <p>The past decade has seen a statistically significant uptick in reports of the bacterialstrains known as “super-bugs,” so called not because of enhanced virulence, but because oftheir resistance to many antimicrobial agents. In particular, researchers have become alarmedabout NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase), which is not a single bacterial species, but a transmittable genetic element encoding multiple resistance genes. A resistance “cocktail” suchas NDM-1 could bestow immunity to a bevy of preexisting drugs simultaneously, rendering thebacterium nearly impregnable. bacteria reproduce asexually through binary fission, viruses lack the necessary structuresfor reproduction, and so are known as “intracellular obligate parasites.” Virus particles calledvirions must marshal the host cell’s ribosomes, enzymes, and other cellular machinery in orderto propagate. Once various viral components have been built, they bind together randomlyin the cellular cytoplasm. The newly finished copies of the virus break through the cellular membrane, destroying the cell in the process. Because of this, viral infections cannot betreated ex post facto in the same way that bacterial infections can, since antivirals designed tokill the virus could do critical damage to the host cell itself. In fact, viruses can infect bacteria(themselves complete cells), but not the other way around. For many viruses, such as thatresponsible for the common cold sore, remission rather than cure is the goal of currently available treatment. number, “the biggest near-miss of our lifetime.” Despite being the most lethal pandemic inhistory, HIV could have caused far worse effects. It is only fortunate happenstance that thisvirus cannot be transmitted through respiratory droplets, as can the viruses that cause modernstrains of swine flu (H1N1), avian flu (H5N1), and SARS.</p>

            <p>6. <b>(B).</b> Focus on the keywords “infections by bacteria” (which can be rearranged to “bacterial infections”). What does the text say about bacterial infections? The second paragraph gives a direct clue: “viral infections cannot be treated ex post facto in the same way that bacterial infections can.” In other words, bacterial infections can be treated “ex post facto” (which means “after the fact”). Choice (B) matches this idea. Regarding (A), the second paragraph states that bacteria themselves “reproduce asexually through binary fission,” but that isn’t necessarily true about <i>infections</i> by bacteria. Regarding (C), the first paragraph notes that resistance “cocktails” such as NDM-1 actually make bacteria “nearly impregnable.” As a result, an infection by bacteria that have this cocktail would be less vulnerable, not more vulnerable. Choices (D) and (E) are true about viral infections, but not bacterial infections.</p>

            <p>7. <b>(A).</b> This Specific Detail question asks what is true about “intracellular obligate parasites” (or IOPs, to give them a temporary abbreviation). The second paragraph states: “Whereas bacteria reproduce asexually through binary fission, viruses lack the necessary structures for reproduction, and so are known as ‘intracellular obligate parasites.’” The word “so” toward the end indicates that viruses are called IOPs because they “lack the necessary structures for reproduction.” Choice (A) captures this idea.</p>

            <p>(A)Individuals who play the lottery are less likely to win a big payout than they are to be killed in a car crash.</p>

            <p>(C)Public officials shouldn’t gamble.</p>
            <p>(D)Many public officials are easily tempted to violate rules governing their positions.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>2. <b>(C).</b> The correct answer is an assumption that the author believes to be true in drawing the conclusion, which is “public officials shouldn’t buy lottery tickets” (as indicated by “therefore”). The argument claims that “buying lottery tickets is a form of gambling” and “therefore,” a certain group shouldn’t do so. The author must believe that this group, the public officials, should not gamble.</p>
            <p>(A) People who play the lottery are not likely to win, it’s true. This is a reason why people in general should not buy lottery tickets. However, the correct answer needs to address why “public officials” specifically “shouldn’t buy lottery tickets.”</p>
            <p>(B) It’s irrelevant whether some public officials are guilty of more serious offenses than gambling.</p>
            <p><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> This choice provides the necessary link between lottery tickets and public officials. Premise: “Buying lottery tickets” = “gambling.” Conclusion: “Public officials shouldn’t buy lottery tickets.” The missing assumption, which this choice supplies word for word, is “public officials shouldn’t gamble.” If an argument says “certain people shouldn’t do X because X is Y,” then the assumption is that those certain people shouldn’t do Y.</p>
            <p>(D) It may be true that many officials are tempted to violate the rules, but this assumption does not have to be made in drawing the given argument.</p>
            <p>(E) Like choice (A), this choice provides a reason why people in general shouldn’t play the lottery, but it does not address why “public officials” specifically “shouldn’t buy lottery tickets.”</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>3. <b>(C).</b> The question asks what judgement, or conclusion, must follow from the exact words of the passage. Answers that could be true are incorrect.</p>
            <p>(A) The argument states that “[s]ome say that Saddlebrook College provides the best value in our state,” and then offers evidence opposing that statement. It does not have to be true that Tunbridge provides the best value in the state; there could be other colleges in the state.</p>
            <p>(B) The passage provides no information about entrance requirements or the quality of the student body.</p>
            <p><b>(C) CORRECT.</b> The second sentence in the passage describes various ways in which Tunbridge is a better value than Saddlebrook, so it must follow that Saddlebrook is not the best value.</p>
            <p>(D) This choice represents an assumption in the argument—that income after graduation is part of evaluating which college provides the best value—but the question asks for a conclusion, not an assumption within the argument.</p>
            <p>(E) This choice is irrelevant—“satisfaction” is not the same as “value.”</p>
