            <p>85. <b>Pathetic, of actual decreases, sentenced.</b> The first sentence alone provides little indication of what the first blank should be: there is a “low rate of growth” and “the 2007 financial crisis,” which are both negative, but the blank isn’t necessarily so. Economists describe the low rate of growth as surprising? Not surprising? Terrible? Normal? Read on for more context. Blank (ii) describes examples of something that causes “a corresponding decline in lifestyles.” The best fit is “actual decreases,” which refers back to the “wages” in the first sentence. “Medical bills” represent a cost, but this goes unquantified, so to claim “a corresponding decline in lifestyles” would be a stretch. “Buoyancy” when applied to the economy means a high level of activity, so this choice is the opposite of what is needed. With “actual decreases” in the second sentence, there is better context for the first blank. Economists (in general) describe a “low rate of growth in wages,” and “many cite examples of actual decreases,” which is even worse, so indeed the first blank should be something like “paltry” or “poor”; “pathetic” in this context is a synonym. “Promising” is opposite and “partisan,” which means biased or prejudiced, is unrelated. The final sentence continues the negative characterization of this “unfortunate trend,” predicting “years of poverty and deprivation” for an “often blameless” group. “Uplifted” and “devoted” are too positive, but “sentenced” to (i.e., punished with) “years of poverty and deprivation” works.</p>

            <p>Like Evelyn Waugh, Martin Amis infuses his prose with his own (i) __________ wit.

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="BF">
            <p>86. <b>Scintillating, wry.</b> The first blank describes Martin Amis’s “wit.” The second sentence describes Amis’s novels as full of sharp “jibes,” or insulting remarks; “scintillating,” which means clever or amusing, describes such an author’s wit quite well. “Sartorial” (relating to style of dress) and “feckless” (incompetent or good-for-nothing) are great GRE words, but don’t describe a clever author’s wit. The second sentence says that because of the author’s wit, descriptions of sad and horrible scenes “often bring a _________ smile to the reader’s lips.” Why would a reader smile when reading about something awful? The smile must be ironic, because of the contrast between the tragic scene and the clever writing. The word that fits best is “wry,” which can mean ironic. A “disapproving” smile doesn’t make sense, and there is no need for a reader to be “discreet” or inconspicuous while reading a disturbing section of a book; no one else knows what the reader is smiling about anyway.</p>

            <p>87. <b>Chide.</b> The sentence describes what the teacher “gently” does to “students who don’t do their homework.” She is too “amiable” (friendly or good-natured) to punish them, so the blank must mean something like lightly criticize, or “chide.” The adverb “gently” is important here, because it’s impossible to gently “detest” or “pillory” them (attack or ridicule publicly). “Malign” (say bad things about) is also too negative, and Ms. Llewellyn doesn’t punish anyone, so “penalize” doesn’t work.</p>

            <p>88. <b>Punctiliousness.</b> What was the case “for eons” is contrasted with the situation “now,” which is that “laxity and tardiness” are “fashionable” and “considered appropriate.” So it must be that the blank is some behavior that is not lax or not tardy. “Punctiliousness,” which is the state of being strict in observance of formalities, fits with the former, and with the latter, too, if punctuality is a formality. “Probity,” which means integrity or honesty, certainly fits with “virtuous,” but doesn’t contrast with what is happening “now.” Two of the choices are antonyms: “parsimoniousness” means frugality to the point of stinginess and “prodigality” is the quality or situation of spending money without care. Though opposite, both are negative and wouldn’t be “considered not only polite, but virtuous,” nor do they contrast with “laxity” or “tardiness.” The final choice, “panache,” meaning flamboyance or flair, is not indicated by the sentence—don’t read too much into “fashionable.”</p>

            <p>89. <b>Voluble.</b> The first clues in this short sentence are “bombastic” (pompous and verbose) and “long,” one of which should agree with the blank. The word “eloquent” should contrast with the blank due to “rather than.” “Voluble,” which is used to describe someone who talks incessantly, fits perfectly. “Unscrupulous” and “hostile” are negative but don’t really relate to talking too much in a pompous way. “Frank,” meaning direct and sincere in speech, is neither in direct agreement nor in direct disagreement with any of the clues. And finally, “languid,” which means slow and relaxed, is not supported by the rest of the sentence.</p>

            <p>90. <b>Specter.</b> If elementary school students ran drills in which “they had to dive under their desks and curl up into a ball,” there was a fear or a threat that was a daily part of people’s lives. A secondary meaning of the word “specter” (which can also mean ghost) is something widely feared as a dangerous occurrence. “Annihilation,” “brutality,” “detonation,” and “arms race” all seem to fit with the theme of a nuclear holocaust, but these words do not mean fear or threat.</p>

            <p>85. <b>Laziness, sloth.</b> On the one hand, the professor believes that all her students are “well-qualified academically.” On the other hand, some students do poorly in the professor’s class. So if they’re doing poorly despite being qualified, she assumes that each of these students isn’t trying hard. “Ineptness” and “incompetence” make for a really appealing pair here, as both could describe a student who is doing poorly in a class. However, this pair does not also account for the fact that the students are “well-qualified” and, therefore, can’t be considered inept. “Laziness” and “sloth,” which means laziness or a reluctance to work, both fill this blank nicely and are the correct answers. It’s worth noticing the other pair here, “moral turpitude” and “amorality,” both of which mean a lack of morals. While the students might be lazy, there is no evidence that their poor performance has anything to do with their morals.</p>

            <p>86. <b>An incipient, a nascent.</b> While the environmental movement has been around awhile, it has only recently become a “serious organization.” In other words, the movement can be said to be relatively new, in a way. The answer choices “disorganized” and “nebulous” don’t fit that meaning. The other pair, “inconsequential” and “immaterial,” is needlessly negative. “Incipient” and “nascent” capture the idea that, while the movement has been around for a while, it is only just now becoming a serious and relevant organization.</p>

            <p>87. <b>Bolstered, buttressed.</b> It is critical to work out here whether the physicists mentioned at the end of the sentence were for or against Einstein’s theory. The sentence suggests that the idea went from “purely experiential” to “theoretically” something. There’s a contrast here, and the contrast is not between right and wrong. It is between something that has been shown by experiment and something that has been understood theoretically. The later scientists are providing support for Einstein. “Undermined” and “sabotaged” are negative, while “condoned” and “pardoned” don’t fit the meaning. Only “bolstered” and “buttressed” correctly express the idea of support.</p>

            <p>88. <b>Manacled, fettered.</b> They wanted to “keep the prisoner _________,” but the “restraints would prejudice the jury.” So the plan must have been to keep this prisoner restrained. “Manacled” and “fettered” are very close synonyms that mean chained or restrained and are, therefore, the correct pair. “Incensed,” meaning “angry,” pairs somewhat nicely with “nettled,” meaning irritated or annoyed. While they make a good pair, they do not mean restrained. Neither “malleable,” meaning bendable or easily influenced, nor “incomparable” fit the context of the sentence.</p>

          <p>While critics contend that the views expounded on in <i>Against Method</i> are tantamountto scientific anarchism, its author Paul Feyerabend maintains that his views stem not from adesire to promote scientific chaos so much as from a recognition that many of the fundamentaltenets of science—rationality, empiricism, and objectivity, for example—are as seriously flawed as the “subjective” paths to truth that scientists are quick to repudiate. Feyerabend goes furtherby arguing that many methods that are now condemned in the scientific community playeda critical role in historical moments of scientific progress. The fact that these methods helpedscience advance in the past indicates that scientists should think twice before they condemnthem. Much of <i>Against Method</i> is a case study of the events surrounding Galileo’s single-handedrejection of the geocentric cosmological model in favor of the updated heliocentric model.Feyerabend goes to lengths to point out that what ultimately allowed Galileo to succeed inconvincing the Western world that the earth revolved around the sun (and not the other wayaround) was the use of methods most modern scientists would deem highly suspect. For example, in attempting to explain why the rotation of the earth did not cause a rock droppedfrom a tower to follow a curved, rather than a straight, path, Galileo relied on several as-yetunproven hypotheses about the laws of motion, essentially begging the question for hisown position. Additionally, his published works display a rhetorical style that reads more likepropaganda than like scholarly work. By showing that these methods were critical to a crucial scientific advancement, Feyerabend casts doubt on whether these “unscientific” practicesreally deserve the criticism they so often garner.</p>

            <p>103. <b>(A).</b> According to the passage, Feyerabend wants to demonstrate that historic instances of scientific progress were themselves marked by these flaws, and thus should not be seen as flaws at all. To this end, he describes a situation that any scientist would agree is an example of progress and shows how it made use of practices that are now condemned by scientists. Feyerabend basically implies that scientists have a choice between throwing this out as an example of good science or accepting these practices as part of good science. Since scientists are unlikely to say that the introduction of heliocentrism was a bad thing, they will be forced to “revise their account of what is and is not acceptable scientific practice.” Thus, (A) is correct. Choice (B) is wrong because the point of the case study is that Galileo is a <i>good</i> example of science. As for choice (C), “subjectivity” is called “seriously flawed” in the first paragraph. Choice (D) says tautological reasoning is acceptable only when it’s being tautological. This is not why Feyerabend makes use of a</p>

This premise indirectly supports the researchers’ conclusion. The second boldface portion is another supporting premise, this one citing a specific study showing that dieters who do not keep a diet record eat more than they realize.</p>
            <p>(A) The first boldface is not the conclusion; it is an observed fact. The second boldface is evidence that the researchers’ conclusion is correct, but is not evidence that the first boldface is correct.</p>
            <p>(B) The first boldface is a fact that supports the researchers’ theory, but it does not explain why their conclusion is correct—the other premises do so.</p>
            <p>(C) The first boldface is a fact that supports the researchers’ theory, but it does not illustrate the truth of that theory—the second boldface does. The second boldface is a fact that supports the researchers’ theory; it is not a competing theory.</p>

The argument assumes the efficacy of its conclusion—in other words, that the conference will actually be effective in creating job opportunities. Attacking an assumption is an effective way to weaken an argument.</p>
            <p>(A) If anything, this choice strengthens the argument. If immigration does not provide a labor pool, it is more likely that a shortage will ensue.</p>

          <p> The anticipated retirement of tens of thousands of baby boomers will create an unprecedented opportunity to move significant numbers of people into career-track jobs at family-supporting incomes. Major industries, from health care and construction to automotive repair, will soon face deep shortages of workers as a result of projected growth and boomer retirements. Fortunately, many of these jobs have relatively low barriers to entry and could be filled by out-of-work young people. To achieve this result, the city government should convene employers and educators to determine how best to create paths of upward mobility in these fields.</p>
