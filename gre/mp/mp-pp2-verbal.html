            <p>7. <b>Preposterous.</b> The sentence states that two things were thought to be equally unlikely in 1986. But today, while one of those events still seems quite far-fetched, the other is commonplace, making the argument sound absurd or “preposterous.” “Preternatural” means what is beyond normal or natural and is used to express mysterious or exceptional events. This argument isn’t really mysterious as much as it is wrong. Note that “prescient” (ability to foretell the future) is the opposite of what the sentence requires—because the prediction about the future was entirely wrong, it does not sound “prescient.” To “preordain” is to decide or determine an outcome in advance. While the fact that banking transactions from home are commonplace now could possibly imply that the transactions were “preordained,” the argument against such a possibility would neither be preordained nor sound preordained. Finally, “pithy” means concise, and nothing in the sentence suggests that the argument is concise.</p>

            <p>8. <b>Lionize.</b> The bad news: there are a lot of hard words in this question. The good news: the sentence itself is relatively straightforward. There is a “widespread tendency” to do something, and that tendency “stems from [a] need to venerate” somebody. So the tendency described by the blank should be similiar to “venerate.” “Castigate” means to punish or reprimand—the opposite of what you need. “Remember” and “appreciate” both seem to work, if somewhat imperfectly, but neither is strong enough to match “venerate” (treat with deep respect or awe). These are spin traps—close, but not quite right. “Indemnify” is a complicated word. It can mean to free someone from responsibility for some as yet uncommitted wrongdoing—sort of like handing someone a “Get out of jail free” card. It can also mean to promise money against a potential loss, as is the case with insurance. Fortunately, neither of these meanings, complicated though they are, aligns with “venerate.” Only “lionize”—to grant someone celebrity status—works in this context.</p>

            <p>9. <b>Cerebral, intellectual.</b> From the beginning, the passage sets up a dichotomy between the work of the brain and the work of the body. The second sentence compares how “[blank] work strains the mind” to how “physical work strains the body,” and so blank (i) should be a word describing the “musings of a mathematician” as they compare to “the physical labor of a carpenter.” Here, again, the word should be something that goes along with academic and “cerebral.” “Quotidian” means everyday, common, or unextraordinary. “Extraordinary” is the opposite of “quotidian” and doesn’t offer the counterpoint to “physical labor” necessary for this blank. “Intellectual,” however, fits blank (ii) perfectly.</p>

            <p>10. <b>Amusing, caustic.</b> The clue “usual” means that the two blanks must match “humorous” but acerbic—and in that order. “Slanderous” and “serious” are, respectively, unrelated to and the opposite of humorous, making “amusing” the only possible answer choice for the first blank. Similarly, “acerbic” needs to pair with a word that means something similar to sharp or sarcastic. “Caustic” is a perfect synonym, while “considerate” is the opposite of what is needed and “hysterical” might match the first blank but not the second.</p>

Incorrect answers “irony” and “comedy” add an idea—humor—that was not indicated by the sentence.

            <p>12. <b>Abreast of.</b> The word “although” indicates that what the professor is doing is unusual or not required of a retired person. “Takes pains” also indicates that what she is doing is difficult. To keep “abreast of ” a topic is to remain current and is therefore the correct answer. “Akimbo” means in a hands-on-hips stance, which would probably be a pain but isn’t something the professor could do “to the latest developments in her field.” “Obtuse” (slow-witted) does not fit the desired meaning. There’s no reason to believe that the professor is “subservient to” the developments in her field. And finally, “askance” means with a look of disapproval, which also doesn’t fit in this sentence.</p>

            <p>7. <b>Paean, tribute.</b> A “retrospective” would be an exhibit that shows the history and progression of the artist’s work, but this exhibit only shows the good parts (it “glossed over” the weaker work and omits the artist’s “dissolution,” which literally means ending, but metaphorically could mean his failure at the end). Thus, the blank needs a word that has something to do with praising. “Paean” and “tribute” are the only matches. A “paean” is generally a song or speech of praise and is used metaphorically here. “Polemic” and “tirade” both mean a long angry speech, and so do not fit the blank.” “Panacea,” which means a cure-all, also has the wrong meaning, as does “critique.”</p>

            <p>8. <b>Flagging, enervated.</b> After “a long, hard practice” in hot weather, naturally the players would be tired. “Flagging” and “enervated” both mean tired. Although the players who withstood such a demanding practice likely are “hale” and “vigorous,” it wouldn’t make sense to say that they “were visibly” healthy or energetic after working very hard. “Lissome,” which means slim and graceful, and “loathsome,” which means repulsive, are great GRE words, but they don’t fit the meaning of this sentence</p>

            <p>9. <b>Medley, mélange.</b> The feast includes a “variety of dishes,” so the sentence requires a word that means mixture or multitude. “Medley” and “mélange” both mean mixture. “Paucity” and “dearth” both mean scarcity, so that pair is at odds with the idea that there are many different dishes. “Rarity” could perhaps refer to the scent of dishes that are only made once a year, but “anomaly” refers to something that deviates from the norm, so these two words can’t be the correct pair.</p>

The latest statement is “unlike the politician’s earlier evasions and equivocations” because it is an explicit, clear, or obvious lie. “Bald” and “overt” both match. The trap answers “tacit” and “implicit” (hinted at, unspoken) are synonyms that mean the opposite of what the blank requires. “Didactic” and “rhetorical,” which could both describe a speech that is intended to instruct, are near synonyms that form a pair.

            <p>11. <b>Priggish, punctilious.</b> The blank requires a word that is the opposite of the words “lighthearted” and “liveliness and spontaneity,” so something like strict would match. “Priggish,” which means self-righteous, and “punctilious,” which means conscientious, are not quite synonyms, but are both related to taking the rules much too seriously. “Lax” is a reversal trap, as is “impious,” which means irreverent; both words are possible antonyms for strict. Neither “equable,” which means even-tempered, nor “auspicious,” which means favorable or promising, fits the desired meaning nor have matches, so they are also incorrect.</p>

            <p>12. <b>Touted, promoted.</b> The sentence says that certain people “were once ignored” but are “now being _________ as the new frontier.” The blank, then, has to mean something like not ignored in a new or novel way. If something is “touted” or “promoted,” someone is trying to sell it, at least figuratively, which fits with the idea that mainstream media and marketing companies are trying to promote gays and lesbians as the new frontier in consumer spending. “Scrutinized” is tempting, because it could be regarded as the reverse of being ignored, but it has no match and thus cannot be a correct answer. “Revered” is similarly tempting, but again it does not have a match and so cannot be the answer. “Subverted,” or undermined, is a good GRE vocabulary word, but it can’t be the answer because, like “predicted,” it doesn’t fit the sentence.</p>

The fact that the “twist” occurs in the second paragraph (the passage is not talking just about science—now it’s talking about history and philosophy) supports the position that the second paragraph is more central to the main idea and that the first paragraph is background information. Choice (A) is wrong because it does not mention the main content of the second paragraph, the ideas and assumptions that became controversial. It is also too broad—giving a history of supernovae would take a lot more than two paragraphs. Choice (B) is correct—the passage does describe a “shift in thought” (from the unchangeable “heavens” to a more scientific view), and this shift was prompted by a “natural event” (the supernova). Choice (C) is attractive but does not describe the main idea. While Galileo and the philosophers certainly had different views about the bright light they saw in the sky, it’s not clear that philosophers had “views about supernovae” in general. Choice (D) can be stricken due to “corroborate” (to prove true or support with evidence). The passage is describing, not making an argument. Finally, choice (E) is too broad.

Supernovae generate enough heat to create heavy elements, such as mercury, gold, and silver.Although supernovae explode frequently, few of them are visible (from Earth) to the naked eye. the “star” (some posited that perhaps it was merely “vapour near the earth”), but seriouslyundermined the views of many philosophers that the heavens were unchangeable.

The second statement cannot be proven. Just because a supernova in 1604 caused a stir does not mean no one else had ever seen one before. The third statement also cannot be proven. Galileo disagreed with the philosophers, but those particular philosophers may never have changed their minds.</p>

            <p>10. <b>(C).</b> As a result of the supernova in 1604, Galileo gave popular lectures in which he “sought to explain the origin of the ‘star’” and which “undermined the views” of some philosophers. Choice (A) mixed up some wording from the first paragraph to set a trap; the earth was not made after the supernova of 1604. Choice (B) is too extreme—Galileo “sought to explain” the origin of the supernova, but it is unclear whether he succeeded. Choice (C) is true—the lectures were “widely attended by the public.” (A very picky person might point out that just because people go to a lecture doesn’t mean they are interested, but all of the other answers are definitely wrong, so that confirms that this is a reasonable—that is, very tiny—inferential leap.) Choice (D) is attractive, but is a trap answer. Galileo, in his lectures, “undermined” (weakened) the views of the philosophers. But the passage doesn’t say what the philosophers’ responses were or whether the philosophers were opposed to the lectures themselves (a person could be opposed to the ideas in a lecture but still think the lecturer should be allowed to lecture). Choice (E) is also attractive because the modern reader knows this to be true in real life. However, the question does not ask, “What really happened?” It asks: “The author mentions which of the following as a result of the supernova of 1604?” The author does not mention that the philosophers were “proved wrong.” Their views were “undermined,” which is much less extreme.</p>

            <p>11. <b>1st and 3rd only.</b> Kincaid’s critics point out that Britain’s government is not as corrupt as Antigua’s. Kincaid makes a witty rejoinder, but does not deny that the British government is less corrupt than Antigua’s. This, coupled with her stated belief that Britain is responsible for corruption in Antigua, justifies the first and third statements. As for the second statement, no governments of the “former colonial empire” are discussed in the passage except Antigua’s.</p>

          <p><i>A Small Place</i> is Jamaica Kincaid’s memoir of growing up in Antigua as well as anindictment of the Antiguan government and Britain’s colonial legacy in Antigua. Kincaidblames colonial rule for many of Antigua’s current problems, including drug dealing and sellingoff land for tourist properties. Kincaid’s critics question why, if the British are responsible for the Antiguan government’s corruption, the British government itself isn’t more corrupt. Kincaidhas responded that there must have been some good people among the British, but that theystayed home.</p>

            <p>12. <b>(B).</b> In main idea questions, you can often eliminate one or more answers just based on the first word or phrase in the answer: <i>relate, discuss, give a history, make a case, emphasize.</i> Does the passage “make a case”? It doesn’t—like almost all GRE passages, it is merely reporting facts and/or the opinions of others, so (D) is wrong. “Emphasize” in choice (E) is also a bit strange—usually, the purpose of a passage is something a little bigger than just “emphasizing” something. The first paragraph gives background information about <i>Don Giovanni,</i> while the second paragraph gives the “twist”—even though almost the whole world loved <i>Don Giovanni,</i> people in Mozart’s own hometown were less enthusiastic about it. Choice (B) matches this—the passages discusses how the opera <i>Don Giovanni</i> was met by “diverging” (differing) opinions, specifically those of Viennese audiences versus those of everyone else.</p>

            <p>13. <b>(A).</b> The second paragraph states that “[t]he opera mixed traditions of moralism with those of comedy—a practice heretofore unknown among the composer’s works—resulting in a production that was not well-liked by conservative Viennese audiences.” The language “a practice heretofore unknown” indicates that Mozart had not done this before. Correct answer (A) is a good match—a “lackluster reception” means that those who “received” something (the audience) were unimpressed. Note that the GRE is trying to hide the correct answer a little bit by saying “a particular group of people” for “Viennese audiences.” Also note that (D) and (E) are incorrect because the author does not “argue” or “undermine” at any point. Talking about moralism and comedy doesn’t address the plot, as mentioned in choice (B), and the passage does not mention what is common in contemporary (modern) opera, so choice (C) is out of scope.</p>

            <p>14. <b>(E).</b> According to the passage, “conservative” Viennese audiences did not like <i>Don Giovanni</i>’s “heretofore unknown” mixing of moralism and comedy. It can be inferred that Viennese audiences disliked the opera’s adventuresome genre-blending and preferred works that kept to “stylistic conventions,” as noted in choice (E). Choices (A) and (B) contain extreme language (“purely,” “unequivocally”). Choices (C) and (D) go too far.

          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>4. <b>(B).</b> The researchers have confused correlation with causation. If two traits X and Y are found together (in this case, red cars and speeding tickets), it does not mean that X causes Y. It could be that Y causes X, or that some third factor Z causes both. In addition, the researchers have made a second assumption—that the increased number of speeding tickets is the result of an increase in the number of speeding infractions (and not, say, the increase in attention that a red car might get).</p>
            <p>(A) This choice regarding black cars is completely irrelevant to this argument.</p>
            <p><b>(B) CORRECT.</b> To move from correlation evidence to a cause/effect conclusion, the researchers must assume that no other cause is possible. In this case, they must assume that the color itself does not lead to tickets.</p>
            <p>(C) What color cars police officers drive is irrelevant.</p>
            <p>(D) This choice focuses on an entirely different type of ticket and thus is irrelevant.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>5. <b>(E).</b> The headmaster’s argument explicitly relies on the idea that students perform better on math tests when they are fully awake. Noting the drop in scores, the headmaster reasons that this drop is due to the change in class time as opposed to any other factor or combination of factors. The assumption must make a connection between the time of the class and the waking state of the students.</p>
            <p>(A) The logistics of the schedule are irrelevant to the headmaster’s position that scores would improve if the class time were moved.</p>
            <p>(B) The time at which other schools hold math classes is irrelevant to the headmaster’s argument, especially since the efficacy of that scheduling is not mentioned.</p>
            <p>(C) While this choice could be assumed, it is not necessary to assume that the quality of teaching has little effect to conclude that a time change will raise scores.</p>
            <p>(D) This choice provides an alternative reason for the lower scores that is contrary to the headmaster’s conclusion. Thus, if anything, the headmaster would have to assume the opposite.</p>

          <p>The headmaster at Leawood Day School noticed that scores on math tests were lower this year than in previous years. This year, all students took math courses during the first period of the school day; in years past, they had taken math during the final period of the day.
