            <p>55. <b>Parlous.</b> The correct answer must match dangerous—only “parlous” does this, and it is the correct answer. Note that “suicidal” is too extreme and not indicated by the sentence. Both “prudent” (wise) and “providential” (opportune) have the wrong tone for the blank.

            <p>56. <b>Commercial.</b> The sentence gives two clues about the engineer: she is not interested in making products that match “market needs,” and her work is known more for “its technical brilliance” than for “its _________ potential.” Her work is technically good, then, but does not necessarily match “market” or customer needs; that is, it lacks “commercial” potential. Work that has technical brilliance could very well have lots of “scientific,” “academic,” or possibly even “revolutionary” potential; therefore none of these answer choices can be correct, since they do not offer any contrast. “Ergonomic” is a tempting choice since a brilliant piece of engineering might be quite uncomfortable for its user, but an engineer who lacks interest in developing needed products would not necessarily think to create uncomfortable products.</p>

            <p>57. <b>Sangfroid, mercurial.</b> The sentence says that Frederick the Great was known for “his _________ under fire,” but goes on to say that his “equilibrium sometimes failed him.” That is the clue. The blank must mean something like grace or calm. “Sangfroid” (composure) is the best fit. “Intrepidity” (bravery) and “cruelty” do not match the clue. The failed equilibrium and “tirades” are both clues for blank (ii), which describes the way he sometimes behaved with his ministers. “Mercurial” (temperamental) is the best fit. “Fascist” (despotic) and “vainglorious” (boastful) go too far.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="CE">
            <p>58. <b>Paradox, brook.</b> This sentence gives you very little to go on for blank (i); as is often the case, the clue for the first part appears in the second part of the sentence. This second part presents a dilemma indicated by “on the one hand” and “on the other”: “teachers can’t ill-afford to _________ indisputably disruptive behaviors,” but too much strictness can actually promote disruptions. So blank (ii) must be something like “tolerate,” as being tolerant would contradict being “overly strict,” and blank (i) needs a word that indicates a contradiction. Starting with blank (i), “entreaty” means a request, and so doesn’t fit this phrase at all. The “necessity of taking disciplinary action” sounds good in general, but the word “necessity” does not convey the idea of a contradiction. Instead, “paradox,” which means a seemingly self-contradictory situation, is the choice that best communicates the nature of the situation. Moving to blank (ii), “fabricate” means to make up, and “mitigate” means to lessen the impact of something; neither fits the idea of “tolerate.” Here “brook,” which means to tolerate or condone, is the best fit.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="ADI">
            <p>59. <b>A stopgap, paragon, perpetuity.</b> The implication of the phrase “a more permanent solution” is that the original building was not permanent: it was “a stopgap,” or a temporary fix. “An ornament” and “a modicum” (a small amount) don’t fit the desired meaning for the first blank. The clue for the second blank is “canonization.” To canonize something literally means to declare to be a saint, but in its figurative sense, it means to hold up as an exemplar or a “paragon.” The third blank gets its clue from “originally,” which indicates that you are looking for an opposite of transient. “In perpetuity” means forever, which fits. “Consecration” (dedication to the sacred) is a theme trap for “canonization,” a religious step to sainthood, but this word can also describe the process by which something comes to be regarded as figuratively saintlike, or as an ideal example. “Chronology” (order in time) is about time, but does not mean lasts forever.</p>

            <p>60. <b>Amity, mores.</b> The word “though” indicates that the negotiation did not actually proceed smoothly. The first blank comes after “semblance of,” which indicates an outward appearance, especially one different from the reality. The word “disingenuous” backs up that meaning. You need something positive—the parties are showing false “amity,” or friendliness, out of “a superficial adherence to” (pretense of following) customs or rules—“mores.” The other choices for the first blank, “duplicity” (deliberate deceptiveness) and “solace” (comfort or consolation in sorrow) don’t fit logically with “disingenuous.” Similarly, “truisms” (self-evident claims) and “plaudits” (expressions of praise) would create a nonsensical meaning in the second blank.</p>

            <p>55. <b>Delineate, stipulate.</b> A “realistic understanding of the potential boons—and perils,” or advantages and disadvantages, of the new drug requires that people know when they should and should not use it. In other words, the “contexts and symptoms” that are “appropriate” for taking the drug should be “delineated” or “stipulated,” both of which mean spelled out or specified. “Furnish,” which means to provide or to be a source of, might seem close, but one would not provide the times when the drug’s use is appropriate. Instead, the sentence suggests that people need to provide appropriate information about when the drugs should be used. “Outlaw” and “proscribe” form a pair, but one would be unable to ban or forbid “the contexts,” much less “the symptoms,” for using the drug. Finally, “transmute,” meaning to change in form, does not fit the context.</p>

The investors were embarrassed that, when the software got to market, it had already been surpassed! Here is a great opportunity to recycle other words from the sentence to fill in the blank: a “specification” must specify, or call for or describe. “Possessed” is a tempting choice here, but a specification is just a description of a planned product or project and therefore can’t possess the actual capabilities of the software. “Updated” and “enhanced” form a nice equivalent pair, but they don’t quite fit the meaning. Finally, “predicted” does not accurately describe what the “original specification” would do—it wouldn’t forecast the capabilities of the software, it would just describe what they were supposed to do. That leaves “boasted of” and “promised” as the correct answer pair.</p>

It most commonly means unbiased, though it can also mean not interested (two very different meanings). Neither option makes a great sentence here, but just as important, none of the other answer choices has a similar meaning to either definition. “Contemptible” is negative, but with no suggestion of immaturity—make sure to use the clues provided without adding your own ideas.</p>

Camus had only a hint of understanding “rather than” a thorough or complete “understanding.” Both “shrewd” and “penetrating” fit this idea. “Elementary” and “inchoate” are a pair of words that mean simple-minded or still developing, and are the opposite of what the sentence suggests.

          <p>The Tokugawa period (1603–1867) in Japan serves as a laboratory for organizationalbehavior historians for the same reason that Iceland works for geneticists—isolation removesextraneous variables. The Tokugawa shoguns brought peace to a land of warring feudal lords.To preserve that tranquility, the Tokugawa shogunate forbade contact with the outside world, allowing only a few Dutch trading ships to dock at one restricted port. Domestically, in pursuitof the same goal, the social order was fixed; there were four classes—warriors [samurai],artisans, merchants, and farmers or peasants—and social mobility was prohibited. The ensuingstability and peace brought a commercial prosperity that lasted nearly two hundred years. varying ways, humans inevitably fail to anticipate unintended consequences. In the Tokugawaperiod, the fixed social hierarchy placed the samurai on top; they and the governmentwere essentially supported by levies on the peasantry, as the other two classes weredemographically and economically inconsequential. However, prosperity brought riches to thecommercial classes and their numbers burgeoned. Eventually, their economic power dwarfed that of their supposed superiors, the samurai. Simultaneously, the increasing impoverishmentof the samurai adversely affected the finances of the peasantry and the government. By theearly 19th century, this imbalance between social structure and economic reality eroded thestability of the society. This condition, in conjunction with increasing pressure for access fromforeigners, such as Admiral Perry in 1853, led to the collapse of the shogunate in 1867. In short, the success of this imposed order led to its undoing through consequences that were beyondthe ken of the founders.</p>

For centuries afterward, school children learned of the Duke of Marlborough’s victory at Blenheim and the military brilliance of Prinz Eugenof Savoy, an independent territory east of France, as well as the opposing brightness of LouisXIV of France, known as the Sun King, who also built the famous palace at Versailles.

The Treaty of Utrecht, which ended thewar in 1714, ceded the Spanish island of Gibraltar to England. The “Rock of Gibraltar” becamean invincible British fortress that controlled the Mediterranean and thus was of paramountimportance in both world wars. Conversely, the same treaty elevated Prussia to a kingdom,thus setting in motion a chain of events that led to a unified Germany under a Prussian Kaiser instead of one governed by the Austrians, arguably making the bloodshed that consumedthe 20th century more likely.</p>

Such a themeechoes the American nation-building construct—lone, free individuals winning against great odds by employing common sense and ingenuity. This is a story line that Americans hear frombirth; it is no wonder that Lewis’s books are popular despite subjects that are not necessarilyof universal interest. Further support for this thesis is that <i>Moneyball</i> became a major motionpicture and a film of <i>Liar’s Poker</i> is in development.

          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>24. <b>(D).</b> The argument concerns the economic impact on restaurants in Prohibitionland if the service of alcoholic beverages is banned. It presents evidence that, despite restrictions on the service of alcohol in certain areas of Prohibitionland, sales taxes in restaurants in those areas rose at a higher rate than for those in other parts of Prohibitionland. This evidence suggests that the ban would not have any adverse economic impact. To support the restaurant proprietors’ claim, the correct answer choice will call the relevance of the seemingly contradictory evidence into question.</p>
            <p>(A). This answer choice may seem to strengthen the argument that banning the service of alcoholic beverages would have an adverse impact on restaurants. However, as the evidence involves data for the entire year, citing a short-term negative impact on restaurant visitation at the beginning of the year does not measurably strengthen the argument.</p>
            <p>(B) The relative tax rate on food and beverages as compared to other consumer goods is irrelevant.</p>
            <p>(C) A gradual decline in alcohol consumption over the past 20 years would suggest that over time, any ban on alcohol would have an increasingly small impact on restaurant visitation, weakening the proprietors’ argument.</p>
            <p><b>(D) CORRECT.</b> This statement calls the evidence into question by indicating that any measured increase in sales taxes and, presumably, revenues for restaurants that have been operating under the restrictions enacted last year is irrelevant, as the restrictions are arguably completely different than the total ban that has been proposed. This answer choice substantially strengthens the proprietors’ argument by threatening to make the cited evidence irrelevant.</p>
            <p>(E) That overall sales tax revenue did not increase at a higher rate in the provinces that enacted the restrictions on alcoholic beverages weakens the proprietors’ argument, as it makes the cited evidence more compelling by ruling out the possibility of different growth rates in the different areas.</p>

            <p>25. <b>(A).</b> The passage concludes that “the whereabouts of most of the world’s most valuable artwork are probably unknown.” The basis for this claim is that “serious art collectors are discreet” when purchasing or selling significant pieces of art. To weaken this claim, one would need information that demonstrated that serious art collectors, while discreet in purchasing and selling their artwork, were relatively open about the artworks in their possession. Alternatively, one could weaken this claim using information that showed that serious art collectors possessed only a small fraction of the world’s most valuable art. The question asks you to find an answer choice that does <span>not</span> weaken the conclusion.</p>
            <p><b>(A) CORRECT.</b> That the value of a piece of art is subjective is irrelevant to the reasoning of the argument. This choice does not present any information that weakens the link drawn between the whereabouts of valuable artwork and the discretion employed by serious art collectors when purchasing or selling such artwork. Thus, this choice does NOT weaken the conclusion.</p>
            <p>(B) That serious art collectors publicize their art shortly after purchasing it means that the whereabouts of their valuable art must be widely known. This choice makes clear that serious art collectors are discreet only in purchasing and selling their artwork, and that the location of newly purchased artwork is unknown, if at all, for only a short period of time. As such, this choice weakens the conclusion.</p>
            <p>(C) If museums own the vast majority of the world’s valuable artwork, then the practices of serious individual art collectors are essentially irrelevant to the location of most of the world’s valuable artwork. Therefore, this choice weakens the conclusion since the public nature of museums means that the whereabouts of most of the world’s valuable work are widely known.</p>
            <p>(D) Since the majority of the world’s valuable privately held artwork is owned by individuals who are not considered serious collectors, then the practices of serious art collectors are essentially irrelevant to the location of most of the world’s valuable artwork. This choice weakens the conclusion by removing the link between serious art collectors and most of the world’s valuable artwork.</p>
            <p>(E) That the collections of most serious art collectors are often displayed in public settings means that the whereabouts of their valuable art must be widely known. This choice makes clear that serious art collectors are discreet only in purchasing and selling their artwork; once it is in their possession, the artwork is typically unveiled for the public.</p>
