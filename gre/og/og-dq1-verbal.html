              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The sentence explains why dominant interests often benefit from a certain condition. Since the explanation is that they are able to take care of themselves if left alone, it follows that the condition is one in which interference is absent. Thus the best answer is “elimination.” None of the other answer choices suggests an absence of interference — indeed “intensification,” “authorization,” and “centralization” suggest quite the opposite.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>elimination</b> (Choice E).</p>

            <aside>
              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The sentence contrasts the infant’s reactions, part of a normal developmental process, with future unhappiness and anxiety. The missing word describes signs of adolescent anxiety as they relate to the infant. Choice A is correct: “prophetic” signs, like harbingers, foretell future occurrences, and for the infant, adolescent anxiety is a future occurrence. Since an infant cannot literally display signs of adolescent anxiety, “normal,” “monotonous,” and “typical” are all incorrect. And “virtual” is incorrect, because virtual signs are not real signs, and what Kagan is denying is that the infant’s reactions are not real signs of later unhappiness.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>prophetic</b> (Choice A).</p>

              <p>As the words “can occasionally” and “but typically” indicate, the missing word describes an investigation that contrasts with a “search in a definite direction.” Among the answer choices, only “unguided” provides a contrasting description; none of the other choices suggests an appropriate contrast.</p>

            <aside>
              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>In the part following “since,” the first sentence of the paragraph suggests that the subject matter of portraits might not seem to fit with the idea of “high art.” So the suggestion is that the presence of portrait paintings in art museums is in that sense odd or unfitting. Of the choices available for Blank (i), “surprising” is the one that expresses this sense. The second sentence, in contrast to the first, offers a point in favor of portraits — “artistic skill.” So the second sentence is offering a reason why portraits should be in art museums. Of the choices for Blank (ii), “justifies” is the one that completes that thought.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>surprising</b> (Choice A) and <b>justifies</b> (Choice E).</p>

            <aside>
              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The sentence tells us that there is a contrast between the way Simpson related to politics in his college years and how he related to politics later in life. So the choices that complete the blanks must contrast with each other. The part of the sentence beginning with “despite” indicates that Simpson’s relation to politics in his college years did not involve engagement in the political activity that was “rife.” Of the choices for Blank (ii), only “indifferent to” conveys that nonengagement. And of the choices for Blank (i), only “activism” supplies the required contrast with “indifferent to.”</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>activism</b> (Choice A) and <b>indifferent to</b> (Choice E).</p>

              <p>The use of the word “though” establishes a contrast between the blank, which requires a description of the judge’s standing, and “phony allegations of wrongdoing.” Thus the words that best complete the blank must indicate that the judge’s reputation was not adversely affected by these allegations. The only words that do so are “undiminished” and “undamaged” (Choices B and D), which produce sentences alike in meaning. “Undecided” and “unresolved” also produce sentences alike in meaning, but neither word makes sense when inserted into the blank.</p>

The passage does not rule out the possibility that one can have an opinion about issues related to a dispute without taking sides in the actual dispute. Choice C is incorrect because it is a presupposition on which the passage is based rather than the point of the passage; that is, the fact that the mediator is acceptable to both parties is a given, since they both ask the mediator to serve.

          <p>Was Felix Mendelssohn (1809<!--&#8211;-->—1847) a great composer? On its face, the question seems absurd. One of the most gifted prodigies in the history of music, he produced his first masterpiece at sixteen. From then on, he was recognized as an artist of preternatural abilities, not only as a composer but also as a pianist and conductor. But Mendelssohn’s enduring popularity has often been at odds — sometimes quite sharply — with his critical standing. Despite general acknowledgment of his genius, there has been a noticeable reluctance to rank him with, say, Schumann or Brahms. As Haggin put it, Mendelssohn, as a composer, was a “minor master … working on a small scale of emotion and texture.”</p>

          <p>While most scholarship on women’s employment in the United States recognizes that the Second World War (1939<!--&#8211;-->—1945) dramatically changed the role of women in the workforce, these studies also acknowledge that few women remained in manufacturing jobs once men returned from the war. But in agriculture, unlike other industries where women were viewed as temporary workers, women’s employment did not end with the war. Instead, the expansion of agriculture and a steady decrease in the number of male farmworkers combined to cause the industry to hire more women in the postwar years. Consequently, the 1950s saw a growing number of women engaged in farm labor, even though rhetoric in the popular media called for the return of women to domestic life.</p>

            <p>Which of the following statements about women’s employment in the United States during and after the Second World War is most clearly supported by the passage?</p>

            <p><span>C</span> The end of the Second World War was followed by a large-scale transfer of women workers from manufacturing to agriculture.</p>
            <p><span>D</span> The increase in women’s employment that accompanied the Second World War was longer lasting in agriculture than it was in manufacturing.</p>
            <p><span>E</span> The popular media were more forceful in calling for women to join the workforce during the Second World War than in calling for women to return to domestic life after the war.</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The correct choice for this question is <b>Choice D</b> We are told in the passage that women’s employment in manufacturing fell quickly after men returned from the war. However, not only did women’s employment in agriculture not decline after the end of the war, it actually increased. The other choices are incorrect because the passage provides no information about what women who joined the workforce wanted to do; about the distribution of women across industries; about what happened to women who left manufacturing; nor about media appeals for women to join the wartime workforce.</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>Given the description of the passage above, it is clear that <b>Choice B</b> is correct: the passage focuses on “different theories about the transport of plant seeds to Hawaii.” Choice A can be eliminated: while the passage does refer to flotation experiments, it does not elaborate on experimental methods. Choice C identifies an idea that is part of the passage’s main concern, but since this is only one of the competing theories discussed in the passage, not the primary focus, Choice C is incorrect. Choices D and E are incorrect because the passage does not resolve any disputes.</p>

          <p>Since the Hawaiian Islands have never been connected to other land masses, the great variety of plants in Hawaii must be a result of the long-distance dispersal of seeds, a process that requires both a method of transport and an equivalence between the ecology of the source area and that of the recipient area.</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>This question asks why the author mentions flotation experiments. Flotation experiments are mentioned in the passage in order to show that some evidence casts doubt on the claim that ocean currents were the means by which seeds were transported to Hawaii. Thus, <b>Choice D</b> is correct. Choice A is incorrect since the claim that plant distribution in Hawaii is the result of long-distance dispersal of seeds is a given in the passage, not an idea that the author feels a need to substantiate. Choice B is eliminable since the flotation experiments are introduced at a point where the author is challenging, rather than lending credibility to, the air current hypothesis and because flotation experiments would more likely reflect on ocean currents than air currents. Choice C is eliminable since the passage does not address the length of time required for long-distance seed dispersal. Finally, Choice E is eliminable since it too describes an idea that is not discussed in the passage.</p>
