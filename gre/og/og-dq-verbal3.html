              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The colon indicates that the second part of the sentence will explain the first part. The missing word will describe the opposite of the cynical conviction that “everybody has an angle,” that is, that each person is concerned primarily with his or her own interests. Since “disinterestedness” means lack of self-interest, Choice D is correct. None of the other answer choices means something that is contrasted with or opposed to being primarily concerned with one’s own interests.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>disinterestedness</b> (Choice D).</p>

            <aside>
              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The reference to human nature and long distances suggest that it is rather routine for drivers to exceed the speed limit in this state. “Cherished tradition” best fits this context for Blank (i), since there is nothing in the sentence to suggest that speeding here is “controversial” or “disquieting.” In Blank (ii) we need to consider what the legislature would do that would surprise no one with regard to increased penalties for speeding. Given what we have learned so far, “rejected” is the best answer; it would be surprising if the legislature “endorsed” or even “considered” increased penalties for speeding.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>cherished tradition</b> (Choice B) and <b>rejected</b> (Choice F).</p>

            <aside>
              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The correct answer for Blank (i) must support, or at least be consistent with, the contrast between Serling’s account, which emphasizes the recklessness of the company’s decision making, and the company’s image, that of a bureaucracy full of wary managers. For Blank (i), “belies” is the best choice since Serling’s account would certainly belie or contradict the company’s image. “Exposes” makes little sense since the image presumably is already out in the open, and there is nothing in the sentence that suggests Serling’s account “overshadows” the company’s image. As for Blank (ii), “a cautious” is the most logical choice. Neither “an injudicious” nor “a disorganized” makes sense in Blank (ii) as they both go against the notion of wariness.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>belies</b> (Choice A) and <b>a cautious</b> (Choice F).</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>Since the author of the paragraph has described the poet’s reputation as “well-earned,” the correct completion for Blank (i) must be something that is consistent with what the rest of the passage says about the poet’s work. Only “near impenetrability” fulfills this requirement, since the next sentence tells us that the poet’s work is “severe” and “densely forbidding,” which rule out both accessibility and frivolity. The Blank (ii) completion must contrast with “ample output,” and of the available options, only “penitential austerity” does so. Finally, the word in Blank (iii), since it is preceded by “newfound,” must refer to the change that has occurred in the poet’s work. The change the paragraph has described is an increase in output, so “volubility” is the correct choice.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>near impenetrability</b> (Choice C), <b>penitential austerity</b> (Choice D), and <b>volubility</b> (Choice H).</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The first two sentences introduce two contrasting sets of managers. The managers identified in the second sentence view systems designed to help manage environmental concerns as “extraneous,” suggesting that they would view environmental performance to be “peripheral” (Choice I) to financial performance. The other options for Blank (iii) — “complementary” and “intrinsic” — are not consistent with the idea that environmental management systems are extraneous. With Blank (iii) filled in, we can go back to Blanks (i) and (ii) with greater confidence: “bolster” works best in Blank (i), since the two sets of managers have contrasting views. Blank (ii) is not straightforward — clearly these managers would not “hotly dispute” this claim, but “appropriately acknowledge” is less easily ruled out. “Uncritically accept” makes sense and is confirmed when we look at the final sentence in which the author warns that, in either situation, “the mere presence of a system” is not enough to achieve environmental improvement. In fact, a system is not even necessary. Thus the author of the paragraph does not regard the systems as particularly valuable, ruling out “appropriately acknowledge.”</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>bolster</b> (Choice B), <b>uncritically accept</b> (Choice D), and <b>peripheral</b> (Choice I).</p>

            <aside>
              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The first two sentences present a contrast between extending our knowledge by discovering “new information about the world” — which we are told philosophy does not do — and extending knowledge through some activity involving “things that are closest to us.” The first blank asks us to identify that activity, and although “attainment” makes little sense in context, both “rumination on” and “detachment from” have some appeal. However, the clear implication that philosophy attends to things that ordinarily escape our notice eliminates “detachment from” as a correct answer. Blank (ii) requires something that suggests the importance of familiar things as subjects of philosophical rumination, and “utterly mysterious” does just that. “Essentially irrelevant” and “thoroughly commonplace” do not fit logically since they suggest that these “familiar” things are unimportant. Similarly, Blank (iii) needs to be consistent with the description of those things as familiar and close. “Most prosaic” fits that idea while “refreshingly novel” goes in the other direction. “Somewhat hackneyed” has some plausibility but is too negative given the overall tone of the sentence; there is no indication that those things are in any way trite.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>rumination on</b> (Choice B), <b>utterly mysterious</b> (Choice E), and <b>most prosaic</b> (Choice G).</p>

              <p>The sentence is explaining why the exhibition of the painter’s work was unsatisfactory, and since it says that the painter’s talents were real, the word in the blank has to indicate why those talents were not, in the opinion of the author of the sentence, good enough. The words “limited” and “circumscribed” do so and also produce sentences that are alike in meaning, so this pair forms the correct answer. Although “undiscovered” and “hidden” are similar in meaning, they do not make sense in the context of the sentence, since they do not indicate why the painter’s talents were not adequate. Other choices, such as “partial” and “prosaic” might make sense in context, but none of the other choices that meets that criterion also has a companion choice that would produce another sentence alike in meaning.</p>

              <p>Choice A is incorrect: the passage does not indicate that the tendency of hot air to rise is used in the process, and in fact says that heated air is drawn down, not up, as part of the greenhouse design.</p>
              <p><b>Choice B</b> is correct: the second sentence describes the orientation of a perforated cardboard wall toward the prevailing wind so that hot air blows in and is moistened.</p>

          <p>For hot desert locations with access to seawater, a new greenhouse design generates freshwater and cool air. Oriented to the prevailing wind, the front wall of perforated cardboard, moistened by a trickle of seawater pumped in, cools and moistens hot air blowing in. This cool, humidified air accelerates plant growth; little water evaporates from leaves. Though greenhouses normally capture the heat of sunlight, a double-layered roof, the inner layer coated to reflect infrared light outward, allows visible sunlight in but traps solar heat between the two layers. This heated air, drawn down from the roof, then mixes with the greenhouse air as it reaches a second seawater-moistened cardboard wall at the back of the greenhouse. There the air absorbs more moisture before being cooled off again when it meets a seawater-cooled metal wall, which causes moisture in the air to condense. Thus distilled water for irrigating the plants collects.</p>

              <p>This question requires the reader to identify which of the given relationships between the novel’s first and second parts is one that is described in the passage. According to the first sentence, the first part of the novel tends to confirm the “romantic” reading more strongly than the second. Therefore, <b>Choice D</b> is correct. Nothing in the passage suggests that critics have paid more attention to the second part, that the two parts have little relation, or that the second part is better. Therefore, Choices A, B, and E are incorrect. Choice C is a more extreme statement than any found in the passage, and therefore it is incorrect.</p>

          <p>Many critics of Emily Brontë’s novel <i>Wuthering Heights</i> see its second part as a counterpoint that comments on, if it does not reverse, the first part, where a romantic reading receives more confirmation. Seeing the two parts as a whole is encouraged by the novel’s sophisticated structure, revealed in its complex use of narrators and time shifts. Granted that the presence of these elements need not argue for an authorial awareness of novelistic construction comparable to that of Henry James, their presence does encourage attempts to unify the novel’s heterogeneous parts. However, any interpretation that seeks to unify all of the novel’s diverse elements is bound to be somewhat unconvincing. This is not because such an interpretation necessarily stiffens into a thesis (although rigidity in any interpretation of this or of any novel is always a danger), but because <i>Wuthering Heights</i> has recalcitrant elements of undeniable power that, ultimately, resist inclusion in an all-encompassing interpretation. In this respect, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> shares a feature of <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>This question focuses on the passage’s mention of Henry James and asks what can be inferred from it. The third sentence implies that James represents a very high degree of authorial awareness of novelistic construction and that no such claim is necessarily being made for Brontë. Thus, <b>Choice B</b> is the correct answer. Choice A is incorrect, since the passage does not imply that there are particular difficulties that James understood uniquely among novelists. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not state or imply that James read Brontë. The passage also does not say anything about commentators’ opinions of the unity of James’s works; therefore Choice D is incorrect. Choice E is incorrect because the passage itself offers no information about the unity of James’s novels.</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>This question requires the reader to determine what can be inferred from the passage about its author’s view of the interpretation of novels. Choice A may seem attractive because in the passage the author says that <i>Wuthering Heights</i> has heterogeneous elements that resist inclusion in a unifying interpretive scheme. Choice A is incorrect, however, because the author does not indicate that the unification of different elements is to be avoided in interpretation generally. By contrast, the author’s parenthetical statement about rigidity does present a general warning against inflexibility of interpretation, and it is this that supports <b>Choice B</b> as the correct answer. Choice C is incorrect, as the author actually suggests the contrary of this view in the second sentence of the passage. Although the author mentions recalcitrant elements of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, there is no suggestion by the author that such elements deserve a special focus in interpretation. Therefore Choice D is incorrect. The author of the passage does not indicate which elements, if any, of novelistic construction are most worthy of consideration. Therefore Choice E is incorrect.</p>
