          <p>You should be familiar with the directions for the Argument task and with certain key concepts, including the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>alternative explanation</b>: a possible competing version of what might have caused the events in question; an alternative explanation undercuts or qualifies the original explanation because it too can account for the observed facts</li>
            <li><b>analysis</b>: the process of breaking something (e.g., an argument) down into its component parts in order to understand how they work together to make up the whole</li>
            <li><b>argument</b>: a claim or a set of claims with reasons and evidence offered as support; a line of reasoning meant to demonstrate the truth or falsehood of something</li>
            <li><b>assumption</b>: a belief, often unstated or unexamined, that someone must hold in order to maintain a particular position; something that is taken for granted but that must be true in order for the conclusion to be true</li>
            <li><b>conclusion</b>: the end point reached by a line of reasoning, valid if the reasoning is sound; the resulting assertion</li>
            <li><b>counterexample</b>: an example, real or hypothetical, that refutes or disproves a statement in the argument</li>
            <li><b>evaluation</b>: an assessment of the quality of evidence and reasons in an argument and of the overall merit of an argument</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No matter which approach you take, you should</p>
          <ul>
            <li>carefully read the <b>argument</b> and the specific instructions — you might want  to read them over more than once</li>
            <li>identify as many of the <b>argument</b>’s claims, <b>conclusions</b>, and underlying <b>assumptions</b> as possible and evaluate their quality</li>
            <li>think of as many <b>alternative explanations</b> and <b>counterexamples</b> as you can</li>
            <li>think of what specific additional evidence might weaken or lend support to the claims</li>
            <li>ask yourself what changes in the argument would make the reasoning more sound</li>
          </ul>
