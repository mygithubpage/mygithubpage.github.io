        <p>For instance, in one topic an elementary school principal might conclude that the new playground equipment has improved student attendance because absentee rates have declined since it was installed. You will not need to see that the principal has committed the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy; you will simply need to see that there are other possible explanations for the improved attendance, to offer some commonsense examples, and perhaps to suggest what would be necessary to verify the conclusion. For instance, absentee rates might have de creased because the climate was mild. This would have to be ruled out in order for the principal’s conclusion to be valid. </p>
        <p>For example, an argument might claim that a certain community event is less popular this year than it was last year because only 100 people attended this year in comparison with 150 last year, a 33 percent decline in attendance. In the example above, the conclusion is that a community event has become less popular. You should ask yourself: does the difference between 100 people and 150 people support that conclusion? Note that, in this case, there are other possible explanations; for example, the weather might have been much worse this year, this year’s event might have been held at an inconvenient time, the cost of the event might have gone up this year, or there might have been another popular event this year at the same time. Each of these could explain the difference in attendance, and thus would weaken the conclusion that the event was “less popular.” Similarly, percentages might support or weaken a conclusion depending on what actual numbers the percentages represent. Consider the claim that the drama club at a school deserves more funding because its membership has increased by 100 percent. This 100 percent increase could be significant if there had been 100 members and now there are 200 members, whereas the increase would be much less significant if there had been 5 members and now there are 10.</p>

        <h4>Question</h4>
        <p>In surveys Mason City residents rank water sports (swimming, boating, and fish ing) among their favorite recreational activities. The Mason River flowing through the city is rarely used for these pursuits, however, and the city park department devotes little of its budget to maintaining riverside recreational facilities. For years there have been complaints from residents about the quality of the river’s water and the river’s smell. In response, the state has recently announced plans to clean up Mason River. Use of the river for water sports is, therefore, sure to increase. The city government should for that reason devote more money in this year’s budget to riverside recreational facilities. </p>
        <p>Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on the assumptions and what the implications are if the assumptions prove unwarranted.</p>

        <h4>Strategies</h4>
        <p>This argument cites a survey to support the prediction that the use of the Mason River is sure to increase and thus recommends that the city government should devote more money in this year’s budget to the riverside recreational facilities.</p>
        <p>A successful response, then, must discuss both the argument’s <b>assumptions</b> AND the <b>implications</b> of these assumptions for the argument. A response that does not address these aspects of the task will not receive a score of 4 or higher, regardless of the quality of its other features. </p>

        <p>some <b>assumptions</b> of the argument, and some ways in which the argument depends on those assumptions, include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>people who rank water sports “among their favorite recreational activities” are actually likely to participate in them. (It is possible that they just like to watch them.) </li>
          <li>what residents say in surveys can be taken at face value. (It is possible that survey results exaggerate the interest in water sports.) </li>
          <li>Mason City residents would actually want to do water sports in the Mason River. (As recreational activities, it is possible that water sports are regarded as pursuits for vacations and weekends away from the city.) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These assumption underlies the claim that <b>use of the river for water sports is sure to increase after the state cleans up the Mason River</b> and that the city should for that reason devote more money to riverside recreational facilities.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the park department devoting little of its budget to maintaining riverside recreational facilities means that these facilities are inadequately maintained.  If current facilities are adequately maintained, then increased funding might not be needed even if recreational use of the river does increase.</li>
          <li>the riverside recreational facilities are facilities designed for people who participate in water sports and not some other recreational pursuit.</li>
          <li>the state’s cleanup will occur soon enough to require adjustments to this year’s budget.</li>
          <li>the cleanup, when it happens, will benefit those parts of the river accessible from the city’s facilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These assumptions underlies the claim that the city should devote more money in this year’s budget to riverside recreational facilities.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the dirtiness of the river is the cause of its being little used and that cleaning up the river will be sufficient to increase recreational use of the river. (Residents might have complained about the water quality and smell even if they had no desire to boat, swim, or fish in the river.) This assumption underlies the claim that the state’s plan to clean up the river will result in increased use of the river for water sports.</li>
          <li>the complaints about the river are numerous and significant. (Perhaps the complaints are coming from a very small minority; in which case cleaning the river might be a misuse of state funds.) This assumption motivates the state’s plan to clean up the river and underlies the claim that use of the river for water sports is sure to increase.</li>
          <li>the city government ought to devote more attention to maintaining a recreational facility if demand for that facility increases.</li>
          <li>the city should finance the new project and not some other agency or group (public or private).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Should any of the above assumptions prove unwarranted, the implications are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>That the logic of the argument falls apart/ is invalid/ is unsound.</li>
          <li>That the state and city are spending their funds unnecessarily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Score 6 Response</h5>
        <p>While it may be true that the Mason City government ought to devote more money to riverside recreational facilities, this author’s argument does not make a cogent case for increased resources based on river use. It is easy to understand why city residents would want a cleaner river, but this argument is rife with holes and assumptions, and thus, not strong enough to lead to increased funding.</p>
        <p>Citing surveys of city residents, the author reports city resident’s love of water sports. It is not clear, however, the scope and validity of that survey. For example, the survey could have asked residents if they prefer using the river for water sports or would like to see a hydroelectric dam built, which may have swayed residents toward river sports. The sample may not have been representative of city residents, asking only those residents who live upon the river. The survey may have been 10 pages long, with 2 questions dedicated to river sports. We just do not know. Unless the survey is fully representative, valid, and reliable, it can not be used to effectively back the author’s argument.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the author implies that residents do not use the river for swimming, boating, and fishing, despite their professed interest, because the water is polluted and smelly. While a polluted, smelly river would likely cut down on river sports, a concrete connection between the resident’s lack of river use and the river’s current state is not effectively made. Though there have been complaints, we do not know if there have been numerous complaints from a wide range of people, or perhaps from one or two individuals who made numerous complaints. To strengthen his/her argument, the author would benefit from implementing a normed survey asking a wide range of residents why they do not currently use the river.</p>
        <p>Building upon the implication that residents do not use the river due to the quality of the river’s water and the smell, the author suggests that a river clean up will result in increased river usage. If the river’s water quality and smell result from problems which can be cleaned, this may be true. For example, if the decreased water quality and aroma is caused by pollution by factories along the river, this conceivably could be remedied. But if the quality and aroma results from the natural mineral deposits in the water or surrounding rock, this may not be true. There are some bodies of water which emit a strong smell of sulphur due to the geography of the area. This is not something likely to be afffected by a clean-up. Consequently, a river clean up may have no impact upon river usage. Regardless of whether the river’s quality is able to be improved or not, the author does not effectively show a connection between water quality and river usage.</p>
        <p>A clean, beautiful, safe river often adds to a city’s property values, leads to increased tourism and revenue from those who come to take advantage of the river, and a better overall quality of life for residents. For these reasons, city government may decide to invest in improving riverside recreational facilities. However, this author’s argument is not likely significantly persuade the city goverment to allocate increased funding.</p>

          <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
          <p>This insightful response identifies important assumptions and thoroughly examines their implications. The proposal to spend more on riverside recreational facilities rests on a number of questionable assumptions, namely that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The survey provides a reliable basis for budget planning;</li>
            <li>The river’s pollution and odor are the only reasons for its limited recreational use;</li>
            <li>Efforts to clean the water and remove the odor will be successful.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>By showing that each assumption is highly suspect, this essay demonstrates the weakness of the entire argument. For example, paragraph 2 points out that the survey might not have used a representative sample, might have offered limited choices, and might have contained very few questions on water sports. Paragraph 3 examines the tenuous connection between complaints and limited use of the river for recreation. Complaints about water quality and odor may be coming from only a few people, and even if such complaints are numerous, other completely different factors may be much more significant in reducing river usage. Finally, paragraph 4 explains that certain geologic features may prevent effective river cleanup. Details such as these provide compelling support.</p>
          <p>In addition, careful organization insures that each new point builds upon the previous ones. Note, for example, the clear transitions at the beginning of paragraphs 3 and 4, as well as the logical sequence of sentences within paragraphs (specifically paragraph 4).</p>
          <p>Although this essay does contain minor errors, it still conveys ideas fluently. Note the effective word choices (e.g.,“rife with . . . assumptions” and “may have swayed residents”). In addition, sentences are not merely varied; they also display skillful embedding of subordinate elements. Note, for example, the sustained parallelism in the first sentence of the concluding paragraph.</p>
          <p>Since this response offers a cogent examination of the argument and also conveys meaning skillfully, it earns a score of 6.</p>

        <h5>Score 5 Response</h5>
        <p>The author of this proposal to increase the budget for Mason City riverside recreational facilities offers an interesting argument but to move forward on the proposal would definitely require more information and thought. While the correlations stated are logical and probable, there may be hidden factors that prevent the City from diverting resources to this project.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the survey rankings among Mason City residents. The thought is that such high regard for water sports will translate into usage. But, survey responses can hardly be used as indicators of actual behavior. Many surveys con ducted after the winter holidays reveal people who list exercise and weight loss as a top priority. Yet every profession does not equal a new gym membership. Even the wording of the survey results remain ambiguous and vague. While water sports may be among the residents’ favorite activities, this allows for many other favorites. What remains unknown is the priorities of the general public. Do they favor these water sports above a softball field or soccer field? Are they willing to sacrifice the municipal golf course for better riverside facilities? Indeed the survey hardly provides enough information to discern future use of improved facilities.</p>
        <p>Closely linked to the surveys is the bold assumption that a cleaner river will result in increased usage. While it is not illogical to expect some increase, at what level will people begin to use the river? The answer to this question requires a survey to find out the reasons our residents use or do not use the river. Is river water quality the primary limiting factor to usage or the lack of docks and piers? Are people more interested in water sports than the recreational activities that they are already engaged in? These questions will help the city government forecast how much river usage will increase and to assign a proportional increase to the budget.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the author is optimistic regarding the state promise to clean the river. We need to hear the source of the voices and consider any ulterior motives. Is this a campaign year and the plans a campaign promise from the state representative? What is the timeline for the clean-up effort? Will the state fully fund this project? We can imagine the misuse of funds in renovating the riverside facilities only to watch the new buildings fall into dilapidation while the state drags the river clean-up.</p>
        <p>Last, the author does not consider where these additional funds will be diverted from. The current budget situation must be assessed to determine if this increase can be afforded. In a sense, the City may not be willing to draw money away from other key projects from road improvements to schools and education. The author naively assumes that the money can simply appear without forethought on where it will come from.</p>
        <p>Examining all the various angles and factors involved with improving riverside recreational facilities, the argument does not justify increasing the budget. While the proposal does highlight a possibility, more information is required to warrant any action.</p>
        
        <section>
          <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
          <p>Each paragraph in the body of this perceptive essay identifies and examines an un stated assumption that is crucial to the argument. The major assumptions discussed are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>That a survey can accurately predict behavior,</li>
            <li>That cleaning the river will, in itself, increase recreational usage,</li>
            <li>That state plans to clean the river will actually be realized,</li>
            <li>That Mason City can afford to spend more on riverside recreational facilities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Support within each paragraph is both thoughtful and thorough. Paragraph 2, for example, points out vagueness in the wording of the survey: Even if water sports rank among the favorite recreational activities of Mason City residents, other sports may still be much more popular. Thus, if the first assumption proves unwarranted, the argument to fund riverside facilities — rather than soccer fields or golf courses — becomes much weaker. Paragraph 4 considers several reasons why river cleanup plans may not be successful (the plans may be nothing more than campaign promises, or funding may not be adequate). Thus, the weakness of the third assumption undermines the argument that river recreation will increase and riverside improvements will be needed at all.</p>
          <p>Instead of dismissing each assumption in isolation, this response places them in a logical order and considers their connections. Note the appropriate transitions between and within paragraphs, clarifying the links among the assumptions (e.g.,“Closely linked to the surveys . . . ” or “The answer to this question requires . . . ”).</p>
          <p>Along with strong development, this response also displays facility with language. Minor errors in punctuation are present, but word choices are apt and sentences suitably varied in pattern and length. The response uses a number of rhetorical questions, but the implied answers are always clear enough to support the points being made.</p>
          <p>Thus, the response satisfies all requirements for a score of 5, but its development is not thorough or compelling enough for a 6.</p>

        <h5>Score 4 Response</h5>
        <p>The problem with the arguement is the assumption that if the Mason River were cleaned up, that people would use it for water sports and recreation. This is not necessarily true, as people may rank water sports among their favorite recreational activities, but that does not mean that those same people have the financial ability, time or equipment to pursue those interests.</p>
        <p>However, even if the writer of the arguement is correct in assuming that the Mason River will be used more by the city’s residents, the arguement does not say why the recreational facilities need more money. If recreational facilities already exist along the Mason River, why should the city allot more money to fund them? If the recreational facilities already in existence will be used more in the coming years, then they will be making more money for themselves, eliminating the need for the city government to devote more money to them.</p>
        <p>According to the arguement, the reason people are not using the Mason River for water sports is because of the smell and the quality of water, not because the recreational facilities are unacceptable.</p>
        <p>If the city government alloted more money to the recreational facilities, then the budget is being cut from some other important city project. Also, if the assumptions proved unwarranted, and more people did not use the river for recreation, then much money has been wasted, not only the money for the recreational facilities, but also the money that was used to clean up the river to attract more people in the first place.</p>

        <section>
          <h5>Rater Comments</h5>
          <p>This competent response identifies some important unstated assumptions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>That cleaning up the Mason River will lead to increased recreational use,</li>
            <li>That existing facilities along the river need more funding.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Paragraph 1 offers reasons why the first assumption is questionable (e.g., residents may not have the necessary time or money for water sports). Similarly, paragraphs 2 and 3 explain that riverside recreational facilities may already be adequate and may, in fact, produce additional income if usage increases. Thus, the response is adequately developed and satisfactorily organized to show how the argument depends on questionable assumptions.</p>
          <p>This essay does not, however, rise to a score of 5 because it fails to consider several other unstated assumptions (e.g., that the survey is reliable or that the efforts to clean the river will be successful). Furthermore, the final paragraph makes some extraneous, unsupported assertions of its own. Mason City may actually have a budget surplus so that cuts to other projects will not be necessary, and cleaning the river may provide other real benefits even if it is not used more for water sports.</p>
          <p>This response is generally free of errors in grammar and usage and displays sufficient control of language to support a score of 4.</p>
