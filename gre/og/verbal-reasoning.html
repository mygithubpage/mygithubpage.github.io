            <li><b>Read <i>all</i> the answer choices before making your selection,</b> even if you think you know what the answer is in advance.</li>
            <li><b>Donâ€™t be misled by answer choices that are only partially true or only partially answer the question.</b> The correct answer is the one that most accurately and most completely answers the question posed. Be careful also not to pick an answer choice simply because it is a true statement. </li>
            <li><b>Pay attention to context.</b> When the question asks about the meaning of a word in the passage, be sure that the answer choice you select correctly represents the way the word is being used in the passage. Many words have quite different meanings in different contexts.</li>

          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Evaluate each answer choice separately on its own merits.</b> When evaluating one answer choice, do not take the others into account. </li>
            <li><b>Make sure the answer choice you pick accurately and completely answers the question posed.</b> Be careful not to be misled by answer choices that are only partially true or only partially answer the question. Be careful also not to pick an answer choice simply because it is a true statement. </li>
            <li><b>Do not be disturbed if you think all three answer choices are correct.</b> Questions of this type can have three correct answer choices.</li>

          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Be careful to evaluate each of the relevant sentences in the passage separately before selecting your answer.</b> Do not evaluate any sentences that are outside the paragraphs under consideration. </li>
            <li><b>Do not select a sentence if the description given in the question only partially applies.</b> A correct answer choice must accurately match the description in the question. Note, however, that the description need not be complete, that is, there may be aspects of the sentence that are not fully described in the question. </li>

        <h3>Text Completion Questions</h3>

        <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Identify words or phrases that seem particularly significant,</b> either because they emphasize the structure of the passage (words like although or moreover ) or because they are central to understanding what the passage is about.</li>
            <li><b>Think up your own words for the blanks.</b> Try to fill in the blanks with words or phrases that seem to you to fit and then see if similar words are offered among the answer choices.</li>
            <li><b>Do not assume that the first blank is the one that should be filled first.</b> Perhaps one of the other blanks is easier to fill first. Select your choice for that blank, and then see whether you can complete another blank. If none of the choices for the other blank seem to make sense, go back and reconsider your first selection.</li>
            <li><b>Double-check your answers.</b> When you have made your selection for each blank, check to make sure that the passage is logically, grammatically, and stylistically coherent.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Sentence Equivalence Questions</h3>

        <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
          <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify words or phrases that seem particularly significant, either because they emphasize the structure of the sentence (words like although or moreover ) or because they are central to understanding what the sentence is about.</li>
            <li>Think up your own words for the blanks. Try to fill in the blank with a word that seems to you to fit and then see if two similar words are offered among the answer choices. If you find some word that is similar to what you are expecting but cannot find a second one, do not become fixated on your interpretation; instead, see whether there are other words among the answer choices that can be used to fill the blank coherently.</li>
            <li>Double-check your answers. When you have selected your pair of answer choices for the blank, check to make sure that each one produces a sentence that is logically, grammatically, and stylistically coherent, and that the two sentences mean the same thing.</li>
