              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The words “on the other hand” indicate that while the existence of societal codes of behavior is no surprise, their character may be quite surprising. Thus the correct answer is Choice B, <b>unexpected</b>, which means the same as surprising. “Predictable” is the very opposite of surprising, and none of the other answer choices means “surprising.”</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>unexpected</b> (Choice B).</p>

              <p>In this example, both blanks can be filled by focusing on the statement that Crawford agonized over the details in her representations of folk music performances. The only choice for blank (ii) that matches this description is “fastidiousness”; neither “didacticism” nor “iconoclasm” reflects the notion of agonizing over details. Similarly, only “reverence for” fits in Blank (i), since neither “detachment from” nor “curiosity about” reflects the degree of care Crawford took.</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>Looking at Blank (i), it is hard to select a correct answer, since all three answer choices fit the immediate context well. Looking to the second part of the sentence, however, we can see such expressions as “hide” and “smoke screens,” both of which suggest that the correct answer for Blank (i) is “deceptive.” Making that assumption, we can go on to see that the answer for Blank (ii) is “dissimilar,” since what is deceptive about political advertisements is that they hide important differences. Reading the sentence again with “deceptive” and “dissimilar” in place confirms those choices.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>deceptive</b> (Choice C) and <b>dissimilar</b> (Choice E).</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>A quick overview of the paragraph shows that its topic is the encouragement of invention and innovation. This implies that Blank (i) should be filled with “come through,” which emphasizes the importance of invention; the other choices suggest that invention is irrelevant or somehow harmed by growth. Again, the only one of the choices for Blank (ii) that continues the theme of encouraging invention is “aside from supporting.” Finally, the second sentence emphasizes the importance for innovation of a strong patent office, and this thought is reaffirmed in the following quotation from Mr. Russell, which requires “protect” in Blank (iii).</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>come through</b> (Choice C), <b>aside from supporting</b> (Choice E), and <b>protect</b> (Choice H).</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The paragraph appears to be explaining some odd or unexpected aspect of the patent process. The third sentence helps to clarify what this aspect is; it discusses challenges to patents. The only choice for Blank (ii) that is concerned with challenging a patent is “debunking,” since “corroborating” and “advancing” suggest support instead. This in turn provides the answer for the third blank, since the preceding sentence does explain how “bogus” devices may nonetheless get a patent. And we can also now better understand the first sentence — it too must help explain how bogus devices get patents, which it can do only if the blank is filled with “presumed verifiable,” suggesting that patent applications are taken at face value and not dismissed out of hand nor subjected to careful scrutiny.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>presumed verifiable</b> (Choice A), <b>debunking</b> (Choice F), and <b>bogus</b> (Choice H).</p>

            <p>Ever a demanding reader of the fiction of others, the novelist Chase was likewise often the object of ________ analyses by his contemporaries.</p>

            <aside>
              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The use of the word “likewise” indicates that the analyses of Chase’s work by contemporaries were like the readings he gave the fiction of others. Since he is described as a “demanding reader,” the words that best fit the blank will be similar in meaning to “demanding.” The words that meet this requirement are “exacting” (Choice A) and “meticulous” (Choice F), and they produce sentences that are alike in meaning. Although “acerbic analyses” means close to the same thing as “scathing analyses,” both “acerbic” and “scathing” have meanings that are quite different from “demanding,” so neither fits well in the blank.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>exacting</b> (Choice A) and <b>meticulous</b> (Choice F).</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>The sentence explains that the person spoken of is not miserly, since she is quite prepared to be generous. So for the sentence to make sense, the word filling the blank has to be something that is consistent with generosity and yet might, by those without a full understanding of her behavior, be mistaken for miserliness. The words “frugality” and “thrift” fulfill this requirement and yield two sentences that are alike in meaning, so that pair forms the correct answer. Neither “stinginess” nor “illiberality” makes sense in the sentence, since they are synonymous with “miserliness” and inconsistent with generosity. Other choices, such as “diffidence,” might perhaps make a sensible sentence if placed in the blank but do not form part of the correct answer since they have no companion word that would make a sentence of similar meaning.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>frugality</b> (Choice C) and <b>thrift</b> (Choice F).</p>

            <aside>
              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>Because the second half of the sentence illustrates the idea that “structure mirrors thought,” any word that fills the blank must be similar in meaning to “convoluted.” The two words that are similar to “convoluted” are “complicated” and “involved” (Choices A and F), which produce sentences alike in meaning. “Fanciful,” while somewhat similar in meaning to “convoluted,” is not as similar to either “complicated” or “involved” as those words are to each other. The other answer choices are not similar in meaning to “convoluted,” and thus do not produce coherent sentences.</p>
              <p>Thus the correct answer is <b>complicated</b> (Choice A) and <b>involved</b> (Choice F).</p>

Choice A is incorrect both because the sentence does not provide examples and because the collection does not display an awareness of the tenuous nature of representations of reality. Choice C is not correct: although one might suspect that the author’s enjoyment of collections as an adult would be on a more sophisticated level than when she was young, there is no discussion or even suggestion of that in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because the sentence describes the virtues of the collection. The aspects of the collection that the author finds inadequate are not addressed until later.

In no sense mercurial, these great fortunes survived the financial panics that destroyed lesser ones. Indeed, in several cities the wealthiest one percent constantly increased its share until by 1850 it owned half of the community’s wealth. Although these observations are true, Pessen overestimates their importance by concluding from them that the undoubted progress toward inequality in the late eighteenth century continued in the Jacksonian period and that the United States was a class-ridden, plutocratic society even before industrialization.</p>

              <h4>Explanation</h4>
              <p>It is important to realize that although most of the passage is devoted to describing Pessen’s study, the author’s main point is to criticize the conclusion Pessen draws. Choices A, C, and D omit any reference to the author’s critical evaluation of Pessen’s study, and hence are not statements of the author’s main point. Choice B is also incorrect. Because Pessen criticizes Tocqueville and the author criticizes Pessen, it might seem that the author’s main point is to defend Tocqueville’s analysis. However, the passage does not indicate that Tocqueville’s analysis is definitive.<b>Choice E</b> is correct. According to the first paragraph, Pessen challenges Tocqueville’s view, but according to the second paragraph, Pessen’s conclusions are incorrect.</p>

              <p><b>Choice C</b> is correct. The “hungry lizard’s instinctive snap” is contrasted with the mammal’s higher level of awareness. Choices A and B are incorrect. The example of the hungry lizard provides a contrast; it does not demonstrate a similarity or extend the author’s argument. Choices D and E are incorrect. Brutality is not mentioned in the passage as a characteristic of predators, and there is no suggestion that all animals lack consciousness.</p>

              <p><b>Choice A</b> is correct. In lines 18<!--&#8211;-->—20, the author defines intelligence in terms of an animal’s use of past experience. In the context of the entire passage, it can be inferred that more intelligent animals, such as the grassland mammals discussed, are better able to use past experience to help them survive than less intelligent animals are. Choice B is incorrect. The second paragraph of the passage indicates that attention is more highly focused in animals of greater, rather than less, intelligence. Choices C, D, and E are incorrect. The author does not discuss muscular coordination as an element in intelligence, gives no indication that in less intelligent species there is less need for competition, and does not discuss how a proper ratio of prey to predator is established.</p>

It directly paraphrases the statement in lines 3<!--&#8211;-->—5, which describes the author’s view of the development of improved brain function in early mammals. Choice B is incorrect. It is likely that the persistence of “free-floating awareness” played a part in the animals’ survival, but there is no indication in the passage that brain function improved because of it. Choices C and D are incorrect: the passage does not discuss the relationship between mammals and reptiles or the interaction between large mammals and less intelligent species. Choice E is incorrect. Improved capacity for memory is an improvement in brain function, rather than a reason for improved brain function.</p>

              <p>This question asks you what does NOT occur during arousal. To answer the question, you must first determine what does occur. According to the passage, arousal does stimulate the production of adrenaline and norepinephrine (lines 24<!--&#8211;-->—26); does increase sensitivity to stimuli (lines 12<!--&#8211;-->—13); and does increase concentration on specific stimuli (lines 16<!--&#8211;-->—18). Thus Choices A through D all describe consequences of arousal. Only <b>Choice E</b> is correct. There is no indication in the passage that the range of states mediated by the brain stem expands during arousal.</p>
