Choice (A) <em>obtuse</em> is a synonym for blunt, so eliminate (A). Choice (B), <em>abominable</em> may describe a bear, but the word doesn't mean “sharp” and so doesn't match the clue, eliminate (B).

If <em>[v]oters</em> are <em>inured,</em> then their response <em>to the levy of a new tax</em> would not be strong. Thus the word in the blank could be “resignation.” Choice (A), <em>amazement,</em> is not a match for “resignation” so eliminate (A).

The blank is describing <em>when…it is desirable to expand the yield of a harvest.</em> The sentence provides further insight into this by stating that <em>it is desirable to expand…yield,</em> but only if there aren't also certain <em>additions in time, exertion and other variable factors of production.</em> So, a word such as “similar” for the blank conveys the logic that expanded yield shouldn't require expanded additions in time and other factors. Choice (A), <em>predestined,</em> is not a match for “similar” so eliminate (A). Choice (B), <em>commensurate,</em> is a good match for the blank so keep (B). Choice (C), <em>deliberate,</em> is not a match for the blank, so eliminate it. Choice (D), <em>analogous</em> is close, but <em>commensurate</em> is more quantitative, so eliminate (D).

            <p><b>7. E </b>. The passage states, “Yet, to remember the man solely by his associations is to miss his importance to nineteenth-century American philosophy as a whole and to the Transcendental Movement in particular,” which suggests the author would agree with (A). In the second paragraph, the author refers to Alcott as a “visionary,” which means ahead of his time, so the author would agree with (B). In the last sentence, the author notes that Alcott believed that “a student's intellectual growth was concomitant with his or her spiritual growth.” This rules out (C). In the second paragraph, the author refers to Alcott's ideas as <em>polemical</em> at the time. <em>Polemical</em> means controversial, thereby implying that Alcott's ideas were not universally accepted, which agrees with (D). The last paragraph of the passage praises Alcott as an erudite orator, a point that is made in direct contrast with his lack of skills as a writer. Therefore, (E) is not supported.</p>

        <p>Bronson Alcott is perhaps best known not for who he was, but for whom he knew. Indeed, Alcott’s connections were impressive by any standards: He was a close confidante of such luminaries as Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau. Yet, to remember the man solely by his associations is to miss his importance to nineteenth-century American philosophy as a whole and to the Transcendental Movement in particular. Admittedly, Alcott’s gift was not as a writer. His philosophical treatises have rightly been criticized by many as being ponderous, esoteric, and lacking focus.</p>
        <p>However, Alcott was an erudite orator, and it is in the text of his orations that one begins to appreciate him as a visionary. Most notably, Alcott advocated what were at the time polemical ideas on education. He believed that good teaching should be Socratic in nature and that a student’s intellectual growth was concomitant with his or her spiritual growth.</p>

        <p><em>Echinosorex gymnura,</em> known colloquially as the moonrat or gymnure, is one of the many fascinating creatures that inhabit the jungles of Southeast Asia. A close relative of the hedgehog, the moonrat likewise belongs to the order <em>Insectivora</em> and the family <em>Erinaceidae</em>. However, the family then splits into the sub-family <em>Hylomyinae</em>, which contains three separate genera and eight distinct species. The appearance and habitat of the moonrat are actually far more similar to those of various members of the order <em>Rodentia</em>, though its eating habits are more in line with its fellow insectivores. Ultimately, the taxonomic classification of this animal is useful only when considered along with other information regarding the animal’s ecological niche.</p>
