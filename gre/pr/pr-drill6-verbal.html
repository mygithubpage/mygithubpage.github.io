Her <em>distant look</em> makes her appear <em>oblivious</em>, or <em>unaware</em>. The word <em>actually</em> signals that the second blank must go in a different direction from the first, and must mean something such as aware. <em>Sedulous</em> means <em>hardworking</em>, which has nothing to do with being <em>aware</em>. <em>Insensible</em> means <em>unaware</em>, and is the opposite of what you’re looking for. <em>Cognizant</em> means <em>aware</em>, and is the best fit for the second blank.</p>

            <p>Veeder thinks something about synonyms, words that mean the same thing. Meaning for him seems to depend upon context and connotation as much as an actual dictionary definition, which would make the notion of synonyms difficult since there would always be external circumstances to consider. Therefore, we need something negative for the first blank at least. That knocks out <em>veracious</em>. <em>Maladaptive</em> doesn’t make sense since nothing is adapting, so <em>fallacious</em> must work. For the second blank we need things that contribute to the meanings of words. Only <em>denotation</em> works. And for the last blank, we need something that says that even synonyms are different. <em>Distinct</em> fits the bill.</p>

            <p>A politician <em>emphasizes</em> his virtues, and so the first blank must mean <em>emphasize</em>. To <em>enfeeble</em> is to <em>weaken</em>, the opposite of what you need. To <em>democratize</em> is to <em>make democratic</em>, and doesn’t mean <em>emphasize</em>. To <em>tout</em> is to <em>emphasize the positive nature of something</em>, and is consistent with the context of the first blank. The clue after the colon refers to a negative consequence of the politicians’ actions, so the second blank must be a negative word. <em>Apt</em> means <em>smart</em> and is a positive word you can eliminate. <em>Injudicious</em> and <em>jejune</em> are both negative words. <em>Injudicious</em> means <em>unwise</em> and <em>ostentatious</em> means <em>pretentiously showy</em>. <em>Injudicious</em> is a better fit for the blank: The problem with the politicians emphasizing their own virtues is that it is <em>ineffective and ill-advised</em>.</p>

However, the author goes on to show that the half-life of carbon can date objects only up to 50,000 years old, or 100,000 years at most if accelerator techniques are used.

          <p> The wombat is a muscular quadruped, about 3 feet in length with a short tail. The animal, which is not a mythical creature but an Australian marsupial, has a name derived from the language of the native peoples of the Sydney area, the Eora aboriginals. Wombats are herbivores and leave cubic scats that are easily recognized. Because wombats are seldom seen, attributed to the fact that they are nocturnal, the scats provide crucial evidence regarding territory. This large, burrowing mammal is not related to the badger, whose habits are similar. In fact, the koala is the wombat’s closest relative. The principal burrowing instrument of the latter is its incisors which, like those of other rodents with orange enamel, are never worn down. Burrows can be extensive and shared by more than one wombat, despite the generally solitary nature of the creature. Territories within the burrow are marked by scent, vocalizations, and aggressive displays. </p>

          <p> Theorists are divided about the cause of the Permian mass extinctions. Some hypothesize that the impact of a massive asteroid caused a sudden disappearance of species. However, a look at the carbon-isotope record suggests that existing plant communities were struck down and re-formed several times. To produce such a pattern would require a succession of asteroid strikes thousands of years apart. Other theorists have proposed that volcanic explosions raised the CO<sub><span class="small">2</span></sub> levels, leading to intense global warming. One problem with this theory is that it cannot explain the massive marine extinctions at the end of the Permian period. A new theory posits that rising concentrations of toxic hydrogen sulfide in the world’s oceans plus gradual oxygen depletions in the surface waters caused the extinctions. Fortunately, this theory is testable. If true, oceanic sediments from the Permian period would yield chemical evidence of a rise in hydrogen sulfide-consuming bacteria. </p>

However, the most recent data from two American Mars Rovers suggest that the terraforming of Mars may be more feasible than previously thought. The rovers found evidence of stratification patterns and cross bedding (indicating a history of sediment deposited by water) in rocks on the edges of craters, as well as chlorine and bromine, suggestive of a large body of salt water. If Mars once held water, it is possible that its atmosphere was at one time somewhat similar to Earth’s. Even if this theory were true, however, scientists would have to prevent a recurrence of the desiccation of the Martian atmosphere once it is made habitable, as well as endeavor to preserve any extant life. Of course, until a reliable method of transporting humans to Mars is developed, any possibility of terraforming is mere conjecture. </p>

          <p> The harshness and extreme unpopularity of the “war communism” system imposed in Russia from 1918 to 1921 led the Soviet leadership to adopt the New Economic Policy (NEP) in March of 1921. Under the NEP, the prodnalog system of tax in kind was begun, and a semi-market economy was allowed to develop alongside government control of what Lenin had called the “commanding heights industries.” When the NEP was abandoned in 1927, the state declared it a failure as a result of several adverse events: the scissors crisis, the goods famine, and speculation by “NEPmen.” </p>
          <p> The scissors crisis of 1923 was caused by high industrial prices relative to agricultural prices. When these two sets of prices are graphed, the wide disparity resembles an open pair of scissors. The government had been spurring industry but felt that this price disparity had to be immediately addressed. To do so, it adopted policies favoring agriculture. There is some speculation by economists, however, that the scissors would have closed on their own. </p>
          <p> The goods famine occurred at roughly the same time. Because of burgeoning industry, demand for industrial and consumer products skyrocketed. The state could not produce goods equal to demand, forcing prices up. In the midst of shortages, the state found itself in a losing contest with “NEPmen,” small entrepreneurs who sold goods at prices often higher than those of the state. NEPmen were seen as capitalists who sought to return the Soviet state to its position as lapdog to the Western capitalist states. Since the state could not produce or profit as well as the NEPmen, it adopted measures to put the NEPmen out of business. By 1926, speculating on pricing was a crime. As a result, profits and incentives had fallen, and the speculation crisis was somewhat alleviated. </p>

          <p> The determination of the age of KNM-ER 1470, a humanoid skull, would add greatly to our knowledge of mammalian evolution. Anthropologists originally dated the <em>habilis</em> skull at 3 million years old. This age seemed unlikely because it was older than the age of any known australophithecines, which are presumed to be the <em>habilis</em>’s ancestor. Further attempts to date the skull have led to speculative results. </p>
          <p> An elemental property of all living things is that they contain a certain portion of their carbon as the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Carbon-14 is created when solar radiation blasts nuclei in the upper atmosphere, in turn producing neutrons that bombard nitrogen-14 at lower altitudes, turning it into carbon-14. All living things maintain an equilibrium of carbon-14 as they exchange carbon with their surrounding atmosphere. Presuming the rate of production to be constant, the activity of a sample can be compared to the equilibrium activity of living matter, and thus the age can be calculated. However, carbon-14 decays at a half-life of 5730 years, limiting age determinations to the order of 50,000 years. This time frame can be extended to perhaps 100,000 years using accelerator techniques. Even so, at these ages carbon dating is increasingly unreliable as a result of changes in the carbon-isotope mix. Over the last century, the burning of fossil fuels, which have no carbon-14 content, have had a diluting effect on the atmospheric carbon-14. As a countervailing effect, atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950s may well have doubled the atmosphere’s carbon-14 content. </p>
          <p> Other radiometric dating methods, using relative concentrations of parent-daughter products in radio decay changes of other elements, such as argon, may prove to be of greater benefit for dating such ancient samples as <em>habilis</em>. However, the assumption that the decay rates of these isotopes have always been constant would first have to be substantiated. </p>

Both <em>crafty</em> and <em>cunning</em> can mean <em>tricky,</em> so choices (B) and (C) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.

The trigger word <em>however</em> signals that the <em>applications</em> were <em>detractors from productivity</em>, but now have the opposite effect, such as <em>to help</em>. <em>Bolster</em> means <em>to add support or improve</em> and <em>ameliorate</em> means <em>to make better</em>, both of which are the opposite of <em>detract</em> and produce equivalent, appropriate sentences. <em>Vilipend</em> and <em>depreciate</em> both mean <em>to reduce the value of</em> and are the opposite meaning of what you want. <em>Engender</em> means <em>to cause to happen</em> and <em>supplant</em> means <em>to replace</em>; neither word works with the clue or in the context of the blank.</p>

            <p>The missing word must be consistent with the clues <em>no new ideas</em> and <em>containing nothing but overt drivel</em>. <em>Lax</em> and <em>amorphous</em> both mean <em>without precision or structure</em>; they’re consistent with the end of the sentence, but not with this clue. <em>Natty</em> means <em>neat and tidy</em>, usually in reference to clothing, and does not reflect the clue. <em>Labyrinthine</em> means <em>unnecessarily complicated</em>, but the problem with the poetry is lack of freshness. <em>Platitudinous</em> and <em>jejune</em> both mean <em>trite or uninteresting</em> and produces equivalent, appropriate sentences.</p>

            <p>The clue is that Gatsby <em>grows progressively more flagrant in his spending and his lifestyle</em>, so the word in the blank must mean something like <em>inclined to spend money unwisely</em>. <em>Ignominy</em> means <em>shame</em> and <em>volubility</em> means <em>talkativeness</em>, but nothing in the sentence indicates that he feels shame or talks incessantly. <em>Repute</em> and <em>stature</em> mean <em>fame</em>; though Gatsby is a famous character, the blank does not refer to his fame. <em>Dissipation</em> and <em>profligacy</em> can both mean <em>inclined to wastefulness</em>, and produce equivalent, appropriate sentences.</p>

            <p>The word in the blank must agree with <em>animated</em>, so anything that means <em>gave life to</em> will work—feel free to recycle <em>animated</em>. Both <em>obliterated</em> and <em>extirpated</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A) and (F). Neither <em>paralleled</em>, which means <em>was similar to,</em> nor <em>exemplified</em>, which means <em>were examples of,</em> is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (D) and (E). Both <em>fomented</em> and <em>galvanized</em> can mean <em>inspired,</em> so choices (B) and (C) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>A good editor is interested in <em>distinguishing the best offerings from the worst in an efficient manner</em>, so your word for the blank needs to mean the same thing as <em>distinguish</em>. Both <em>consolidate</em> and <em>integrate</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A) and (B). Neither <em>finagle</em>, which means <em>to obtain by dishonest or indirect means</em>, nor <em>intimate</em>, which—as a verb—means <em>to insinuate</em>, is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (C) and (D).

            <p>Brand believes that the distinction obscures a <em>more relevant question</em>, so the word in the blank must mean something consistent with <em>not relevant</em>. <em>Baleful</em> means <em>dangerous</em>, and <em>feckless</em> means <em>incompetent or irresponsible</em>, neither of which are close to <em>not relevant</em>. <em>Critical</em> and <em>cardinal</em> both mean <em>important</em>, so those words are the opposite of what you’re looking for.

While an unfamiliar writing style might indeed seem <em>strange</em> to the general public, these words have a supernatural connotation, which would not be a good fit for a description of political theory. <em>Muddled</em> and <em>abstruse</em> both mean <em>confusing</em>, which would be characteristics that would describe jargony writing from the perspective of the general public.</p>
