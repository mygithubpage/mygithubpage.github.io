        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p>Natural selection is an immensely powerful yet beautifully simple theory that has held up remarkably well, under intense and unrelenting scrutiny and testing, for 135 years. In essence, natural selection locates the mechanism of evolutionary change in a "struggle" among organisms for reproductive success, leading to improved fit of populations to changing environments . . .</p>
          <p>Yet powerful though the principle may be . . . natural selection is not fully sufficient to explain evolutionary change. First, many other causes are powerful, particularly at levels of biological organization both above and below the traditional Darwinian focus on organisms and their struggle for reproductive success. At the lowest level of substitution in individual base pairs of DNA, change is often effectively neutral and therefore random. At higher levels, involving entire species or faunas, punctuated equilibrium can produce evolutionary trends by selection of species based on their rates of origin and extirpation, whereas mass extinctions wipe out substantial parts of biotas for reasons unrelated to adaptive struggles of constituent species in "normal" times between such events.</p>
          <p> Second . . . no matter how adequate our general theory of evolutionary change, we also yearn to document and understand the actual pathway of life's history. Theory, of course, is relevant to explaining the pathway . . . But the actual pathway is strongly <i>underdetermined</i> by our general theory of life's evolution. This point needs some belaboring . . . Webs and chains of historical events are so intricate, so imbued with random and chaotic elements, so unrepeatable in encompassing such a multitude of unique (and uniquely interacting) objects, that standard models of simple prediction and replication do not apply.</p>
          <p> History can be explainedâ€”with satisfying rigor if evidence be adequateâ€”after a sequence of events unfolds, but it cannot be predicted with any precision beforehand . . . History includes too much chaos, or extremely sensitive dependence on minute and unmeasurable differences in initial conditions, leading to massively divergent outcomes based on tiny and unknowable disparities in starting points. And history includes too much contingency, or shaping of present results by long chains of unpredictable antecedent states, rather than immediate determination by timeless laws of nature.</p>
          <p><i>Homo sapiens</i> did not appear on the earth, just a geologic second ago, because evolutionary theory predicts such an outcome based on themes of progress and increasing neural complexity. Humans arose, rather, as a fortuitous and contingent outcome of thousands of linked events, any one of which could have occurred differently and sent history on an alternative pathway that would not have led to consciousness . . .</p>
          <p>Therefore, to understand the events and generalities of life's pathway, we must go beyond principles of evolutionary theory to a paleontological examination of the contingent pattern of life's history on our planetâ€”the single actualized version among millions of plausible alternatives that happened not to occur. Such a view of life's history is highly contrary both to conventional deterministic models of Western science and to the deepest social traditions and psychological hopes of Western culture for a history culminating in humans as life's highest expression and intended planetary steward.</p>

Choice (B) is a reversal, as the passage contrasts natural selection from change that is random. Choice (D) is a reversal, as the passage states that “history…cannot be predicted with any precision.” Choice (E) can be eliminated, because the phrase “always be inadequate” is extreme language that is not supported by the text, which refers to natural selection as adequate.

        <div id="passage2" class="passage">
          <p>Occupations foster gender differences among workers in a variety of ways, one of the most pervasive being "internal stratification." That is, men and women in the same occupation often perform different tasks and functions. Even in those occupations that appear sexually integrated, the aggregate statistics often mask extreme internal segregation. Although the proportion of female bakers increased from 25 percent in 1970 to 41 percent in 1980, for example, the majority of female bakers are found in highly automated baking industries, while their male counterparts are located in less automated bakeries. The same phenomenon has been detected among pharmacists, financial managers, and bus driversâ€”all groups where the influx of women workers suggests a diminution of sex segregation.</p>
          <p>Another strategy used to maintain gender differences in supposedly integrated occupations is the use of sumptuary and etiquette rules. When women enter male-dominated occupations, certain rules are often introduced to govern their dress and demeanor. In office settings, for instance, dress codesâ€”either formal or implicitâ€”are not unusual; female employees may be required to wear dresses, nylons, and high-heeled shoes to enhance their femininity. So it is for female marines and male nurses, both of whom are required to dress differently from their male and female Counterparts. Male nurses never wear the traditional nursing cap; female marines never sport the standard Marine Corps garrison cap.</p>
          <p>Informal practices also play a role in constituting femininity in female marines and masculinity in male nurses. As members of visible minority groups, they stand out at work and receive far more than their fair share of attention. This phenomenon was first documented by Rosabeth Moss Kanter, who found that women in corporations, simply by virtue of their numerical rarity, were noticed and scrutinized more than their male counterparts. This added pressure may actually result in different job performances from men and women in nontraditional occupations and exacerbate gender differences. Kanter's corporate women, for example, became more secretive, less independent, and less oppositional in response to their greater visibilityâ€”all traits that have traditionally been associated with femininity.</p>
          <p> Another informal technique that enhances gender differences is practiced by supervisors who evaluate men and women differently. The very qualities that are highly praised in one sex are sometimes denigrated in the other. Thus, a man is "ambitious," a woman, "pushy"; a woman is "sensitive," a man, "wimpy." But it would be a mistake to claim that all gender differences are forced on people. In addition to the external pressures I have just described, male nurses and female marines actively construct their own gender by redefining their activities in terms of traditional masculine and feminine traits. For example, women in the Marine Corps insist that their femininity is intact even as they march cadence in camouflage units. Likewise, male nurses contend that their masculinity is not at all threatened while they care for and nurture their patients.</p>

            <p>The sentence begins with the transition <em>while</em>, indicating a change or contrast in the sentence, so the word in the blank describes her normal <em>conviction that sequels are generally inferior to their predecessors.</em> If her willingness to <em>acknowledge occasional exceptions</em> to that rule contrasts with her normal stance, she must usually be “firm” <em>in her conviction</em> Both <em>wavering</em> and <em>vacillating</em> mean roughly the opposite of “firm,” so eliminate (A) and (B). Neither <em>perturbed</em>, which means disturbed, nor <em>disconsolate</em>, which means gloomy, match the predicted answer, so eliminate (D) and (E). That leaves <em>adamant</em> and <em>resolute</em>, both of which match “firm,” so (C) and (F) are the credited responses.</p>

            <p><strong>C</strong> and <strong>E</strong></p>
            <p>The time transition <em>after decades</em> indicates that something has changed; the first part of the sentence states that the airlines had previously enjoyed <em>decades of stability</em>, so the most recent <em>fifteen years must</em><em>have borne witness to a remarkably</em> “unstable” <em>period for airlines.</em> (Indeed, being <em>part of a merger</em> and filing for <em>bankruptcy</em> are both examples of significant change, and one or both of these are true for <em>virtually every airline</em>) Write down “unstable” and cross off choices that don’t match. Both <em>erratic</em> and <em>volatile</em> match “unstable,” so (C) and (E) are correct. <em>Avionic</em> (with its linguistic similarity to “aviation”) is a trap answer that refers to electronic devices used in aircraft.</p>

            <p>The transition <em>despite</em> indicates that the two parts of the sentence are different; the second part of the sentence states that <em>multiple-personality disorder is in reality remarkably rare</em>, so the contrast must be that the disorder is often used <em>as a plot device in films and television programs.</em> Write down something like “frequentness” for the blank, and cross off words that don’t match. Only <em>pervasiveness</em> and <em>ubiquity</em> match the predicted answer, so (C) and (E) are correct.</p>
