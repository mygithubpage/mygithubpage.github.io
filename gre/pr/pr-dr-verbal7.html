 The author compares the artistic impact of photographs of heads to that of abstract photographs of the same head.</p>

 The author ruminates on what early experiences led to Close’s focus on the head as a unifying theme in his work.</p>

 The author expounds upon how, by not accepting commissions, Close’s work has remained free of commercial influences.</p>

 The author deconstructs the impact that Close’s illness had on the content of his paintings.</p>

            <p><strong>
 E</strong>The author discusses the ways in which Close’s ideas of portraiture differ from tradition, and Close’s emphasis on a head without expression or personality is the opposite of traditional portraiture. Choice (E) best addresses this uncommon approach. Choices (A) and (B) are not suggested in the passage.

          <p> Though artist Chuck Close has devoted his life to portraiture, his paintings rarely comport with that genre’s traditional purpose. His early photorealist images, which are created by overlaying a grid on a photograph and painstakingly copying the image cell by cell, are, to the naked eye, nearly undifferentiable from photographs. Furthermore, Close’s emphasis is on the disembodied head itself, expressionless and devoid of any overt personality. He has never acceded to commissions, relying on both his own image and his friends as models. In 1988, a collapsed spinal artery caused almost total paralysis, but Close has continued to work. His freer paintings evince a natural extension of an augmented interest in the minute grid over the total work that predated his illness. This non-privileging of any particular part of the canvas finds its inspiration, oddly enough, in abstract expressionism, despite the apparent inconsonance of the two techniques. </p>

 B</strong>Choice (A) can be eliminated because, while the text tells you that the paintings are <em>nearly indistinguishable from photographs</em>, there is nothing that says anyone is confused by the paintings. Choice (B) is correct because the passage says, in line 17, that Close’s later work found inspiration from abstract expressionism.

 B</strong>The second sentence of the passage provides Derrida’s description of the concept of difference and includes <em>attempts to discuss universal features of human nature are merely products of local standards.</em> Thus the answer needs to make clear that acceptance does not equate truth.

          <p> The anti-foundationalist belief that there is no secure basis for knowledge was worked out philosophically in the somewhat wearisome tracts of Jacques Derrida. <em>Différance</em>, Derrida tells us, is the idea that any attempts to discuss universal features of human nature are merely products of local standards, often serving the vested interests of the status quo, and should rightly be dismantled and critiqued. Derrida was considered the originator of a profound challenge to the history of human thought. However, a century before Derrida, Darwin’s theory of natural selection had made anti-foundationalism almost an inevitable consequence. From an evolutionary point of view, our understanding of the world depends on earlier and less-developed forms of understanding; meaning is continuously referred or deferred to other terms or experiences. </p>

 A</strong>The author states that anti-foundationalists believe that <em>there is no secure basis for knowledge.</em> Therefore, choice (A) is correct.

          <p> Some readers categorize Maxine Hong Kingston as a great Asian-American writer, a classification that is ultimately too narrow for her body of work. However, the subject matter of Kingston’s novels and autobiographies espouses the Asian immigrant experience, as the following characters suggest: immigrant laborers in California and Hawaii, railroad laborers, and Chinese doctors. In natural harmony with her choice of subject matter are the personal sensibilities of a first-generation American writer who endeavors to explain her mother’s alien sensibility and her relationship with her silent, angry father. </p>
          <p> Kingston’s Asian influences are present in another type of work, Chinese myths in the guise of “talk stories.” A character in her novel Tripmaster Monkey is based on Sun Wu Kong, a mythical Chinese figure. In response to this work, Herbert Gold notes that the author “invigorates her novel with an avid personal perspective, doing what the novel is supposed to do—she brings us the news of the world and makes magic of it.” </p>
