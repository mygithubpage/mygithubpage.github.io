            <p><b>1. Find the clues and transition words.</b> First ask, “<em>Who</em> or <em>what</em> is the blank describing?” Before you try to fill the blank, you must consider what the blank is talking about! In this sentence, the blank describes the kind of <em>orator</em> that <em>Robert Ingersoll</em> was.</p>
            <p> </span>Next ask, “<em>What else</em> in the passage provides <em>insight</em> into that person or thing?” Find information in the surrounding text that provides insight into the kind of orator that Ingersoll was. The sentence tells us that <em>people traveled hundreds of miles to hear his…speeches</em>. So he was obviously a good orator. The sentence also tells us that Ingersoll is <em>virtually unknown today</em>. The transition word <em>although</em> puts this insight into opposition to the word in the blank describing the kind of orator Ingersoll was. Now you know that he wasn’t just a good orator but a well-known one.</p>
            <p><b>2. Come up with your own word or phrase for the blank.</b> Use the insights you’ve gained to come up with your own word for the blank. You don’t have to come up with the perfect word, and it doesn’t have to be a single word. It’s better to be as literal as possible in order to capture your insights. Feel free to recycle language in the sentence when coming up with your own word. From Step 1, you know that Ingersoll was a well-known orator—recycled from the word <em>unknown</em>—and also a good one. To capture all that, you could just call him “famously good.”</p>
            <p><b>3. Check each answer choice.</b> Only now that you’ve come up with your own word (or phrase in this case) compare that word or phrase to the answer choices. Compare each of the answer choices in turn to your own phrase, “famously good.”</p>
            <p> </span>Choice (A) is <em>domineering</em>, which means bossy, is not a match for “famously good.” Eliminate (A). Choice (B), <em>eminent</em>, is a famous or respected person, so keep (B). The word <em>unobjectionable</em>, (C), means something that can’t be objected to, so eliminate (C). Choice (D), <em>conventional</em>, is practically the opposite of “famously good”, so eliminate it. Choice (E), <em>execrable</em>, might stump you, in which case you’d give it a question mark. <em>Execrable</em> means downright detestable. If you knew that, you’d eliminate the word. Either way, you’d go with the answer choice that you’ve assigned a checkmark, (B). Ingersoll was <em>an eminent</em> orator of the nineteenth century.</p>

            <p>Just as before, the blank should describe what kind of playwright Sophocles was. This time, however, you’re given additional information: He completed <em>123 plays</em>, which was <em>double that of…his contemporaries</em>. Now you have something to work with in coming up with your own word. Sophocles wrote a lot of plays, so “productive” could be your word. You could even put down “adjective—wrote lots” on your scratch paper if you weren’t able to come up with a single word that means “wrote lots.”</p>
            <p>Now you’re ready to take on the answer choices. The adjective <em>famous</em> is certainly tempting. Sophocles was unquestionably one of the most famous <em>playwrights of ancient Greece</em>. But this has no connection to the clue, which is all about the number of plays he wrote. One and only one of the answer choices matches the clue—(D), <em>prolific</em>. The other four words may indeed describe Sophocles and sound fine if inserted into the sentence. But only one answer choice will ever match the clue, and that’s what counts.</p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>Begin by asking “Who or what is the blank describing?” The blank is describing <em>the prisoner’s…appearance</em>. Now ask “What else in the passage provides insight into the prisoner’s appearance? The sentence describes this as <em>wan and weakened.</em> Therefore, recycle the words “wan and weakened” as the word for the blank. Now evaluate the answer choices one at a time.</p>
            <p>Upon evaluating the answer choices, many will find that they are a total nightmare. Resolutely work through the answer choices one by one, comparing them to “wan and weakened.” Choice (A) is tough. If you don’t know this word, you can’t eliminate it, so mark with a question mark and leave it for now. You may know that (B), <em>boisterous</em>, means noisy and rowdy. If so, you can eliminate (B). The next choice, (C), is <em>etiolated</em>—another difficult word, so mark it with a question mark and move on. Choice (D) is <em>singular</em>, which we usually think of as the opposite of <em>plural</em>. It can also mean one-of-a-kind or unique. In either sense, it’s not a match for “wan and weakened,” so eliminate (D). The final choice, (E), is <em>circumscribed</em>, which means to restrict something, or draw around, so eliminate (E).</p>
            <p>At this point, you have three eliminated choices and two with question marks, so pick one of the two unknowns. The bottom line is that by using careful POE you have increased your odds to one-in-two. By the way, the answer is (C), <em>etiolated</em>, which describes the pale appearance of plants grown with insufficient sunlight but by extension applies to anything feeble or sickly in appearance.</p>

            <p>Here’s How to Crack It</p>
            <p>Without looking at any answer choices yet, scan the passage and determine which of the blanks has the more obvious clue. Because the second clause makes it clear that something bad is going on—<em>an undue infringement</em>, the first blank is easier to work with. The first blank is describing <em>the states</em>’ reaction to <em>[f]ederal…standards on education achievements</em>. The sentence gives further insight into this by stating that <em>local governments</em> consider this <em>an…infringement</em>. The semicolon is a transition indicating agreement between the clauses. So, the word in the first blank describing the states’ reaction will be something like “resistance.” Now check the answer choices against “resistance.” Choice (A) is the opposite of this, <em>receptivity</em>. Eliminate (A). If you don’t know what <em>intransigence</em> means, then put a question mark next to (B). Choice (C), however, <em>compromise</em>, is not a match for “resistance.” Even if you don’t know what <em>intransigence</em> means, select (B) as it is the only non-eliminated answer. Now, work with the second blank.</p>
            <p>The second blank describes something that <em>local governments</em> feel is negatively impacted by <em>government imposition</em>. The sentence provides insight into this by stating that <em>[f]ederal efforts to regulate standards on education achievements</em>, have not been well-received by <em>the states</em>. A word or phrase for the second blank, then, could be a descriptive phrase like “freedom from intervention by the federal government,” which you might simplify to “the right to govern themselves.” Now check the answer choices. Choice (D), <em>autonomy</em>, means independence or self-government. This is a good match, so keep (D). Choice (E), <em>legislation</em>, is close but too neutral and broad given the clue. Eliminate (E). Choice (F), <em>comportment</em>, means demeanor or the way one carries oneself, so eliminate it.</p>
            <p>The correct answer is <em>intransigence</em> and <em>autonomy</em>.</p>

            <p>Here’s How to Crack It</p>
            <p>The second blank has the strongest clue, so begin there. The second blank is a verb that describes what <em>musicians</em> do to their songs using <em>computers.</em> The sentence gives further insight into how musicians use computers to impact songs by stating that computers result in a <em>precision…unattainable naturally</em>. The transition word <em>and</em> indicates that the word for the blank should be similar to the word <em>modify,</em> which the passage uses to describe the contents of the blank. So, recycle this language and use a word such as “modify.” Choice (D), <em>energize</em>, is not a match for “modify,” so eliminate it. Choice (E), <em>delineate</em>, means to outline or to define, which is also not a match for “modify,” so eliminate (E). Although both these words describe something that musicians could do to their songs, neither is as close a match for the word “modify” as (F), <em>recast</em>. Keep (F) and move on to the blank with the next strongest clue.</p>
            <p>The blank with the next strongest clue is the first blank. The first blank should be a verb describing what <em>[m]any popular musicians</em> have done with <em>new digital technologies.</em> The passage gives further insight into what musicians have done with new technologies by stating technologies gives them <em>control over their music</em> and that <em>[t]hese musicians use computers</em>. Therefore, the word for the first blank should be something close to “use,” so let’s reuse that fairly neutral word. The word for (A), <em>incorporated</em>, is a good fit, so keep (A). Choice (B), <em>synthesize</em>, is a trap answer. It may describe how musicians make their songs using digital technologies, but it doesn’t describe what they do to these technologies. Eliminate (B). Choice (C), <em>alleviate</em>, means to make less severe, so also eliminate (C).</p>
            <p>Now work with the third blank. The third blank is a verb describing the reaction of <em>traditionalists</em> to <em>these developments</em>. The passage provides further insight by stating that these are <em>new technologies</em> and the transition word <em>though</em> indicates that the reaction from <em>traditionalist</em> should be expected to be different than those of the musicians described earlier. Therefore, the traditionalists should have a negative reaction to new technologies, so a good phrase for the blank could simply be “don’t like.” Choice (G) is <em>balk at</em>, which matches “don’t like,” so keep (G). Choice (H), <em>revel in</em>, means celebrate, which is the opposite of “don’t like,” so eliminate (H). Choice (I) is <em>retaliate</em>, certainly negative but this extreme reaction is not suggested by the text, so eliminate (I).</p>
            <p>The correct answer is <em>incorporated</em>, <em>recast</em>, and <em>balk at</em>.</p>

          <div class="explanation">
            <p>The correct answer is (B) and (C), even though <em>inconsequential to</em> and <em>deviant from</em> are not even near-synonyms. Don’t worry too much yet about the best strategy to answer a question like this—we’ll go over that later on. For now, let’s just look at the correct and incorrect answer choices. In this example, each of the two correct answer choices is supported by a different clue in the sentence. <em>Inconsequential to</em> is supported by the fact that that the <em>unconventional political ideology</em> has yet to <em>gather enough support to…replace existing ideologies. Deviant from</em> is supported by the fact that the new ideology has yet to be <em>adopted by…existing ideologies</em>. In this context, however, both words give the same general meaning to the completed sentence. Notice also the two synonyms, <em>a threat to</em> and <em>foreboding to</em>, lying in wait for the unwary test-taker. These words may sound perfectly fine when plugged into the sentence, but they do not correspond to the clues in the sentence.</p>
            <p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that synonym pairs are always the wrong answer on Sentence Equivalence questions. In fact, the correct answers are often synonyms. But, answering a Sentence Equivalence question by picking any pair of synonyms is an unreliable strategy for conquering this portion of the GRE. At best, focusing on synonyms can be a last-resort approach for questions that you find difficult.</p>

            <p>Here’s How to Crack It</p>
            <p>Begin working on this question by first looking for clues and transition words in the sentence. Ask yourself, “<em>Who or what is the blank describing?”</em> The blank describes what <em>the soil</em> was to <em>grains</em>—the relationship between the two. Now, ask yourself “<em>What else in the sentence provides insight into that person or thing?”,</em> or, in this case, what else in the sentence provides insight into the relationship of <em>the soil</em> to <em>grains</em>? The sentence states that <em>ancient Mesopotamians switched from grain production to barley</em> and that <em>excessive irrigation and salt accumulation</em> did something to <em>the soil</em>. These are the clues for the sentence.</p>
            <p>Now that you’ve identified the clue, look for any transition words. In this sentence, the word <em>after</em> suggests that the switch from <em>grain production to barley</em> is the consequence of <em>irrigation and salt accumulation</em>’s impact on <em>the soil</em>. In other words, our two clues are in agreement and reflect the same meaning.</p>
            <p>With all this in mind, now move on to Step 2. Come up with your own word or phrase for the blank that describes the effect on <em>the soil</em>’s relationship to <em>grains</em> brought about by <em>excessive irrigation and salt accumulation</em>—an effect that in turn would have caused <em>ancient Mesopotamians</em> to switch <em>from grain production to barley.</em> If ancient Mesopotamians had to switch from grain production to barley production, then excessive irrigation and salt accumulation must have made the soil bad for grains in some way. So, use the phrase “bad for” and move on to Step 3, checking the answer choices for any choice that indicates something “bad for.”</p>
            <p>Choice (A), <em>indifferent to</em>, does not mean something “bad for” so eliminate (A). Choice (B), <em>inhospitable to</em>, is a good match for “bad for” because if the soil was inhospitable to grain, it would explain why ancient Mesopotamians switched from grain production to barley production. Put a checkmark next to (B). Choice (C), <em>unsuitable for</em>, is also a good match for “bad for” as it would also explain why ancient Mesopotamians switched from grain production to barley production, so put another checkmark next to (C).</p>
            <p>Don’t stop evaluating the answer choices just because you found two that matched your word. Look at the remaining answer choices just in case another answer choice also matches. If that is the case, then you will need to reevaluate your interpretation of the sentence, or determine which words produce sentences that are closest in meaning. Choice (D), <em>acrimonious to,</em> may be a word you are unsure about, so put a question mark next to it. If you happen to know that <em>acrimonious</em> means angry or bitter, then you can eliminate this choice as not quite matching “bad for.” Choice (E), <em>benignant to,</em> may also be a word you are unsure about, so put a question mark next to it as well. Choice (F), <em>inured to</em>, is not a good match for “bad” as inured means to grow accustomed to something, so eliminate (F).</p>
            <p>You have two answer choices with checkmarks next to them, two choices with question marks next to them, and two choices that are eliminated. Select the two answer choices with checkmarks next to them, which is the correct answer.</p>

            <p>Here’s How to Crack It</p>
            <p>The transition word that begins this sentence, <em>despite</em>, tells us that the <em>state</em> in which <em>many aristocrats…lived</em> is the opposite of <em>their noble status</em>. Because noble status is a positive idea, the word in the blank should be negative. This is reinforced by the additional clue that <em>many aristocrats were virtually penniless</em>. Evaluate the answer choices one at a time, eliminating positive words and holding onto negative words.</p>
            <p>Choice (A), <em>indigence</em>, is an uncommon word. Instead of spending time trying to decipher whether it’s positive or negative, just mark it with a question mark and move on. Choice (B) is another uncommon word, <em>opulence</em>, so give that one a question mark as well. Choice (C), <em>eminence</em>, is a positive word—think of someone described as <em>an eminent doctor</em> or as <em>an eminent author</em>. Therefore, eliminate (C) because the word in the blank has to be negative. Choice (D), <em>penury</em>, is another uncommon word, so mark it with a question mark. Choice (E), <em>depravity</em>, means moral corruption. This is certainly a negative word, but would you describe a penniless person as depraved? Not likely, so eliminate (E) as well. The final word, (F), is <em>complacency</em>, which means a feeling of self-satisfaction, so eliminate (F).</p>
            <p>After all that, you have three answer choices remaining—(A) <em>indigence</em>, (B) <em>opulence</em>, and (D) <em>penury</em>. This is a much better situation than guessing from among all six. And if you happen to know that the word <em>opulence</em> is a positive word suggesting luxury, you’ve got the answer—it has to be (A) and (D).</p>

Choice (D) is <em>deleterious</em>, a word similar in meaning to (F), <em>pernicious</em>, the only word remaining. Make these another pair.</p>
            <p>This process eliminates two choices and leaves you with two pairs of synonyms. Guessing at this point will give you a 50/50 chance of getting the correct answer. If you’ve searched for the clue and come up empty-handed, those are not bad odds.</p>
            <p>Here’s how to choose between the answer choices. The blank should describe what kind of substance mercury is. The sentence gives the insight that <em>mercury has a variety of innocuous</em> or harmless <em>uses</em>. The transition word <em>because</em> suggests agreement between this clue and the blank. However, the sentence contains another transition in the phrase <em>few people</em>, which indicates that the word in the blank should actually be the opposite of <em>innocuous</em>. This insight makes the correct answer (D) and (F).</p>

            <p>Here’s How to Crack It</p>
            <p>Find the clue for this Sentence Equivalence question by asking, “Who or what is the blank describing?” If the answer to that question is unclear, then determine the part of speech to more easily answer the question. In this case, the blank is a noun describing some aspect <em>of humankind</em> that <em>cynics</em> have <em>faith in</em>. Now ask, “What else in the sentence gives insight into that person or thing?” This clue comes from the introductory phrase, <em>[d]espite their outward negativity</em>. <em>Despite</em> is a transition word suggesting that <em>their outward negativity</em> is the opposite of their <em>inner faith in</em> some aspect <em>of humankind</em>. Therefore, the blank must refer to some positive aspect of humankind. Pick an appropriate word such as the “good” of humankind for the blank, or focus on positive words in the answer choices. Evaluate the answer choices individually.</p>
            <p>Choice (A), <em>benevolence,</em> is a positive word so keep (A). Choice (B), <em>precocity,</em> is an uncommon word, so put a question mark next to this one. The same can be done for (C), <em>parsimony</em>. Choice (D) has the root word <em>noble</em> in it, which is certainly positive, but the prefix <em>ig</em> makes it a bad thing—think of the word <em>ignorant</em>. Eliminate this choice. Choice (E) has the prefix <em>anti-</em>, meaning against. This generally implies something negative, so eliminate (E). Choice (F), <em>probity</em>, is another tough word, so put a question mark next to it.</p>
            <p>At this point, select (A), as it is the only choice with a checkmark next to it. Choices (B), (C), and (F) all have question marks, so if there is no way to further parse out what those words mean, pick one of them to go with (A) and move on. At the worst, you have a 1-in-3 choice of guessing correctly. Taking the POE a little further, you should also be able to eliminate (B). The word <em>precocity</em> is related to <em>precocious</em>. It also begins with the prefix <em>pre-</em>, meaning before—an idea that’s neither positive nor negative. Choice (C), <em>parsimony,</em> means frugality, and (F), <em>probity</em>, means honesty and integrity. Thus, the correct answer is (A) and (F).</p>

            <p>Here’s How to Crack It</p>
            <p>Find the clue by asking first, “Who or what is the blank describing?” If the answer to that question is unclear, then determine the part of speech to more easily answer the question. In this case, the blank is an adjective describing what <em>tattoos have become…in urban culture</em>. Now ask, “What else in the sentence gives insight into that person or thing?” Clues here are that they were <em>[f]ormerly seen only on sailors and bikers</em> and that, as a consequence of what they’ve become, they have lost <em>any rebel cachet</em>. The word <em>formerly</em> is a transition word suggesting that tattoos—or specifically their cultural significance—have changed in some way. Therefore, the blank should suggest the opposite of being <em>seen only on sailors and bikers</em>. A good word might simply be “common,” so use that for evaluating the answer choices. Evaluate the answer choices individually, looking for reasons to eliminate each.</p>
            <p>Choice (A), <em>prepossessing</em>, might be unfamiliar. Trying to determine the meaning from its parts, you’d come up with something like “owning before.” It’s hard to see how this matches “common,” so eliminate (A). Choice (B) is <em>fascinating</em>. While modern culture may be fascinated with tattoos, it doesn’t match the word “common,” so eliminate (B). Choice (C) is <em>pedestrian</em>. As an adjective, <em>pedestrian</em> can mean either walking on foot or ordinary. In the sense of ordinary, this is a good match for “common,” so put a checkmark next to (C). Choice (D), <em>peripheral</em>, means at the edge of something—not a match for “common.” Eliminate (D). Choice (E), <em>marginal</em>, means the same thing as <em>peripheral</em>, so eliminate it as well. The final choice is (F), <em>pervasive</em>, which describes something that is found everywhere. This could be another way of saying “common,” so (F) earns a checkmark. The answer is (C) and (F).</p>
            <p>Notice some pitfalls that we’ve avoided in this question. Two of the answer choices, <em>peripheral</em> and <em>marginal</em>, are synonyms but don’t match “common.” They’d be tempting if you missed the time transition implying that tattoos have changed from being something unusual. The words <em>prepossessing</em>, meaning impressive or pleasing, and <em>fascinating</em> are another decoy synonym pair. The correct answer choices, <em>pedestrian</em> and <em>pervasive</em>, aren’t strict synonyms. Furthermore, recognizing <em>pedestrian</em> as a correct choice depends on knowing its secondary definition. These are all traps that might have tripped you up before, so you’ve learned a lot!</p>

        <p>Prior to 1735, there was no legal precedent for freedom of the press. The constitutional concept of freedom of the press traces its origins to 1735 and the libel trial of John Peter Zenger. Zenger, born in Germany, emigrated to America in 1710 and established <em>The New York Weekly Journal</em> in 1733. The <em>Journal</em> starkly opposed the policies of New York governor William Cosby and while Zenger did not write the majority of the critical pieces, he was arrested on libel charges in 1734. In the ensuing trial, widely followed by the populace, Zenger was defended by Andrew Hamilton, a Pennsylvania lawyer who was brought in after Cosby disbarred all the New York lawyers who offered to defend Zenger. Hamilton’s brilliant defense of Zenger was <span data-question="14">predicated on</span> the argument that since Zenger’s criticisms involved verifiable facts, they could not possibly be considered libel. The judge agreed and acquitted the publisher, establishing the basic concept of freedom of the press that was to be enshrined in the United States Constitution some 57 years later.</p>

        <p>What was it about Oscar Wilde’s only novel, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, that caused it to create such an uproar when it was published in 1891? <span data-question="16">While critics attacked the quality of Wilde’s work, lambasting its plot as “incurably silly” and chiding the writer for using prose that was “clumsy” and “boring,” these overt denunciations of the formal elements of Wilde’s work merely masked the true concerns of many nineteenth-century critics.</span> What these critics were actually railing against was the thematic content of Wilde’s work, specifically his illustration of a lifestyle devoted to useless beauty. For many a nineteenth-century moralist, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> was nothing more than a primer for spiritual depravity. Wilde’s ultimate sin was not his clunky plot or his sometimes cloying prose; it wasn’t even his disregard for the time-honored tradition of English propriety. It was instead his leniency toward his protagonist. Wilde propagated the disdain of critics not simply because Dorian Gray was an unabashed hedonist, but because Wilde failed to punish his subject appropriately for his hedonism. To the critics, allowing an evil character to escape his just desserts was an unforgivable sin, and it was this transgression that resulted in such opprobrium for Wilde’s work. In their mind, Wilde’s work was corrupting the genteel reading public by failing to show the proper consequences of immoral behavior.</p>

Be careful, and be literal. This is how they catch smart people. If you cannot prove your answer with something stated in the passage, you can’t pick it. If the passage doesn’t say Zenger sought out Hamilton, we can’t assume it. Assumptions always get you into trouble on reading comp.

            <p>Treat this type of question just like a Text Completion problem. Go back to the passage and read the sentence that contains the highlighted phrase, imagining that the highlighted portion is missing: “Hamilton’s brilliant defense of Zenger was ____________ the argument that since Zenger’s criticisms involved verifiable facts, they could not possibly be considered libel.” Try to come up with your own word or phrase for the blank.</p>
            <p>The clue is that the defense had something to do with the “argument that was….” A good phrase might be <em>based on</em> or <em>constructed on.</em> Now go to the answer choices and use POE. Does <em>derived from</em> mean based on? It’s fairly close, so leave this choice. How about <em>extirpated</em>? Remember that if you’re not sure of the meaning of this word, you can’t eliminate it. Leave it for now. Choice (C) is not a match; <em>conjectured</em> means to guess or infer. A <em>covenant</em> is an agreement, so (D) doesn’t make sense either. And <em>relegate</em> means to assign, so that’s out too. If you’re down to (A) and (B), go with the one you know works. Choice (A) definitely works, so that’s our answer.</p>

          <p>A college professor lowers a student’s grade from an A to a B because the student is chronically late to class.</p>

        <div class="answer" data-answer="C">
          <div class="explanation">
            <p>This question wants us to figure out what the response of the critics is and then find a situation that is similar to it. First, return to the passage and read the highlighted sentence. Based on the sentence, it appears that the situation is that “the people attacked this thing for one reason, but there was really another reason they didn’t like it.”</p>
            <p>Now you’re ready to return to the answer choices and look for the best match. The situation in the first answer choice is not the same as what we’ve written; here the professor is penalizing a student for the student’s poor performance in class. Eliminate it. Choice (B) doesn’t match—the accountant is refusing to do something illegal. The third choice seems like a good match; the politician attacks his opponent for one reason (his character), but there was another reason (his policies) for his dislike of the candidate.</p>
            <p>Let’s check the remaining choices to make sure our answer is the best answer. In (D), the district attorney indicts on a lesser charge because of a lack of evidence for a more serious charge. This is somewhat similar, in that there is an overt element (the misdemeanor charge) and also a second factor which is not overt (the felony charge). However, the part of the answer choice that mentions the lack of evidence makes this choice worse than (C). It goes beyond the information presented in the passage because the original situation in the passage doesn’t mention a lack of evidence on behalf of the critics. Finally, (E) is not a match at all. This situation involves a reporter who puts forth something that has not been verified, which isn’t the same as criticizing something for one reason when there is another, deeper reason. Thus, (C) is our answer.</p>

          <p>Some critics of Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray believed that an author of a book had a moral responsibility to the book’s audience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer" data-answer="C">
          <div class="explanation">
            <p>To answer this question, we have to figure out which answer choice the author might agree with. How the heck are we supposed to know what the author might think? Well, all we know about what the author thinks is what’s found in the passage. In many ways, “author-agree” questions are very similar to inference questions. In both types of questions, the correct answer may not be explicitly stated in the passage, but there will be sufficient evidence in the passage to support the correct answer. The key here is to take each answer choice one by one and return to the passage to look for proof for it.</p>
            <p>The first choice states that most critics objected to Wilde’s lifestyle. Can you find any evidence of this in the passage? No. Nowhere does the passage mention his lifestyle. It says that the critics disagreed with the thematic content, but we can’t assume that Wilde based his work on his own lifestyle (and of course, you can’t use any outside knowledge you may have of Wilde’s licentious life). Remember: You have to stay inside the scope of the passage—don’t go beyond the information given. Thus, (A) is no good.</p>
            <p>Now look at the second choice. Is there any evidence about how the author would feel if the book were released today? Nope. Of course, you may assume that the author would agree with this choice, but again, on the GRE that isn’t good enough. We need direct evidence from the passage and there is none for this choice. So, goodbye to (B). Let’s go to the third and final answer. Return to the passage and look for the part about the book’s audience. The last two lines make it clear that some critics saw Wilde’s book as corrupting the public and for this they attacked it. This would support (C), so (C) is the answer. Notice that in these multiple-choice, multiple-answer questions, there need not be two answers—sometimes there will just be one!</p>
