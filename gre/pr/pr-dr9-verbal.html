Now go to the first blank: If some are described as sitting only briefly, and others for longer periods, then something that means <em>period of time</em> would make sense. Of the choices, only <em>duration</em> can mean <em>period of time.</em> The third blank refers to the role the visitors play; since the visitors themselves are half of the performance, you might use a word like <em>necessary</em> to describe what kind of <em>components</em> they are. <em>Integral</em> is another word for necessary, so it’s the best fit.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer=".D">
            <p><strong>D</strong>It is important to read the lines within the context of the passage. Earlier in the passage the author informs us that Lincoln felt <em>disdain</em> for the Mexican-American War. The author notes that given Lincoln’s willingness to fight the Civil War, this seeming inconsistency bears some explanation. From this text, you can infer that one of the goals of both the Mexican-American War and the Civil War was to ensure a united country. Therefore, given that Lincoln supported the Civil War, you can assume that he had reasons for opposing the Mexican-American War on grounds other than unification. Therefore, the correct answer is choice (D).</p>

        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p> The mid-nineteenth century witnessed two major wars on U.S. soil: the Mexican-American War and the Civil War. That Abraham Lincoln would commit the country to civil war appears to require little explanation, since he endorsed the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the young nation. However, Lincoln’s disdain for the Mexican-American War, which was ostensibly fought to keep Texas in the Union, requires some examination. After all, Lincoln’s swift military response to the Southern secessionists at the beginning of the Civil War illustrates that Lincoln would not shrink from battle if the war could ensure a united country. Perhaps Lincoln’s resistance to the Mexican-American War can best be seen in light of his sincere belief that President Polk had overstepped his constitutional boundaries in declaring war against Mexico, a sovereign nation. In this light, it is perhaps ironic that Lincoln’s own presidential legacy includes a greater centralization of federal government power. </p>

However, this shift may not provide the dramatic gains for American business that might have been expected by an enterprise with an ethos for change that is oriented to preserving bottom-line profits. The difficulty is that a significant portion of American society remains uncomfortable with shifting business tasks overseas. Therefore, American businesses will predominantly opt for outsourcing opportunities for repetitive tasks that can easily be brought back to the United States if necessary. Nevertheless, opportunities for Indian firms to get a larger piece of the pie seem certain to arise.

 B</strong>The zooxanthellae need carbon dioxide for their survival, according to line 23, so choice (B) is correct. We know that the zooxanthellae benefit from their relationship with coral, but the passage never says that they couldn’t live without coral, so choice (C) goes too far. Since the zooxanthellae are helpful to the coral, they cannot be <em>parasitical</em>, which rules out choice (D). The passage never says anything about <em>camouflage</em>, so choice (A) is out of scope. The last sentence of the passage says that <em>If zooxanthellate populations continue to decrease without recovery, their host corals will eventually follow suit…</em>, indicating that coral may die without zooxanthellae, so choice (E) is incorrect.</p>

          <p> Scientists are growing increasingly concerned that coral, which grows abundantly in the circumtropical shallow waters near bodies of land, is evincing a paling, or bleaching effect. Though experts are still at odds over what has precipitated this event, most agree that it is a stress response to changes in habitat and water quality, including temperature variations and salination percentage, and predict a loss of 95 percent of existing coral populations. </p>
          <p> An exemplary symbiotic entity, scleractinian coral lives harmoniously with vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. Corals receive nutrients in two ways: by capturing planktonic organisms with nematocyst-capped tentacles and by resource-sharing and recycling with single-celled algae called zooxanthellae. These algae live within the polyps of the coral, using photosynthesis to increase (and thereby strengthen) coral calcification, and providing energy for coral growth. The zooxanthellae benefit from the relationship through protection from predators and a steady supply of necessary carbon dioxide. Interestingly, it is the zooxanthellae that provide coral with its brilliant coloration. </p>
          <p> When coral loses its color, it is a sign that the single-celled algae are not able to thrive. Though not necessarily a sign of mortality, a pale, wan color indicates imminent danger and is considered a stress response. The zooxanthellate invertebrates lose their concentration of pigmentation or die altogether when stressed, turning translucent and allowing the slightly darker coral skeleton to show through the decaying tissue. Whether this response stems from anthropogenic pollutions such as overharvesting coral for the exotic travel market, overfishing coral waters, and increased water temperatures due to global warming, or from natural disturbances (storms, temperature extremes, and diseases), scientists fear for the future of the radiant corals. If zooxanthellate populations continue to decrease without recovery, their host corals will eventually follow suit, triggering a cascade of unanticipated biological events. </p>

            <p>To fill in the blank, you need to find a word that describes the <em>grandmother</em> who is described in the sentence as having <em>the correct answers to life’s difficult dilemmas</em> Therefore, you want to find words that also describe someone who has all the right answers. <em>Sagacity</em> means <em>acuteness of mental discernment,</em> or, more simply, <em>wisdom</em> Meanwhile, <em>bewilderment</em> and <em>ignorance</em> are words describing someone who does not have all the right answers. <em>Duplicity</em> and <em>guile</em> are both words having to do with deceit and lying and are not traits of the <em>grandmother</em> suggested in the sentence.</p>

            <p>The semicolon trigger tells you the two parts of the sentence agree; since the blank is describing the <em>road</em>, you need a word that means <em>twisted</em> Both <em>abbreviated</em> and <em>fleeting</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A) and (C). Neither <em>invigorating</em>, which means <em>energizing,</em> nor <em>immense</em>, which means <em>huge,</em> is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (B) and (D). Both <em>serpentine</em> and <em>tortuous</em> can mean <em>twisted,</em> so choices (E) and (F) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>The blank describes the kind of <em>observation</em> that would surprise people who thought Lucy was unaware, so a word that means something like <em>sharp</em> or <em>observant</em> would make sense—anything that would show that Lucy was aware. Both <em>asinine</em> and <em>obtuse</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A) and (C). Choices (D) and (F) have roughly synonymous meanings, but an observation that was clear wouldn’t have impressed her classmates. Both <em>perceptive</em> and <em>astute</em> can mean <em>observant,</em> so choices (B) and (E) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>The clues are that the <em>guests agreed</em> that <em>had the weather</em> NOT been <em>awful</em>; the implication is that it was otherwise perfect. You are looking for a word that means <em>perfect</em> Eliminate <em>urban</em>, which means <em>metropolitan</em> and has nothing to do with the meaning you need. Eliminate <em>excessive</em> and <em>disproportionate</em>, choices (C) and (D): Though the wedding may have been overdone or out of balance, these are irrelevant to the clues. Finally, eliminate <em>rustic</em>, choice (F), which means <em>having country simplicity</em> The best answers are <em>divine</em> and <em>idyllic</em>, both of which mean <em>perfect</em> and produce equivalent, appropriate sentences.</p>

            <p>The last part of the sentence parallels the middle part. The clue to the blank is <em>the rapid development of numerous related processes</em>, so the missing word must mean <em>rapid development</em> or <em>expansion</em> Eliminate choice (B) since it is the opposite of what you’re looking for. Choices (C), (D), and (E) seem applicable, but none of these choices stays in the scope of the meaning you need in the blank.
