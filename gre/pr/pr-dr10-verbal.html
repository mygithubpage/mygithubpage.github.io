 C</strong>The third paragraph lists a number of factors that contribute to coral bleaching, including <em>overharvesting coral for the exotic travel market</em> This supports the idea that tourist demand contributes to coral bleaching, thus making choice (C) the best answer. The passage says nothing about <em>freight ships, fossil fuels,</em> or <em>governmental apathy</em>, so choices (A), (B), and (D) can be eliminated. The third paragraph does suggest that coral is sensitive to natural climate changes, but it does not say that this sensitivity is <em>unusual</em> as stated in the answer, so choice (E) cannot be properly inferred from the passage.</p>

        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p> Scientists are growing increasingly concerned that coral, which grows abundantly in the circumtropical shallow waters near bodies of land, is evincing a paling, or bleaching effect. Though experts are still at odds over what has precipitated this event, most agree that it is a stress response to changes in habitat and water quality, including temperature variations and salination percentage, and predict a loss of 95 percent of existing coral populations. </p>
          <p> An exemplary symbiotic entity, scleractinian coral lives harmoniously with vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. Corals receive nutrients in two ways: by capturing planktonic organisms with nematocyst-capped tentacles and by resource-sharing and recycling with single-celled algae called zooxanthellae. These algae live within the polyps of the coral, using photosynthesis to increase (and thereby strengthen) coral calcification, and providing energy for coral growth. The zooxanthellae benefit from the relationship through protection from predators and a steady supply of necessary carbon dioxide. Interestingly, it is the zooxanthellae that provide coral with its brilliant coloration. </p>
          <p> When coral loses its color, it is a sign that the single-celled algae are not able to thrive. Though not necessarily a sign of mortality, a pale, wan color indicates imminent danger and is considered a stress response. The zooxanthellate invertebrates lose their concentration of pigmentation or die altogether when stressed, turning translucent and allowing the slightly darker coral skeleton to show through the decaying tissue. Whether this response stems from anthropogenic pollutions such as overharvesting coral for the exotic travel market, overfishing coral waters, and increased water temperatures due to global warming, or from natural disturbances (storms, temperature extremes, and diseases), scientists fear for the future of the radiant corals. If zooxanthellate populations continue to decrease without recovery, their host corals will eventually follow suit, triggering a cascade of unanticipated biological events. </p>

The passage also states that <em>some of the “stars” of country music learned their trade from African-American musicians</em>, implying that the African-American musicians taught them, completing the necessary support for choice (B). The last sentence of the passage states that <em>in addition to jazz,…country music now clearly needs to be included in the list of musical genres that have an African-American lineage</em> This implies that jazz is already <em>commonly acknowledged</em> to arise from the <em>African-American lineage</em>, and this fact supports choice (C).

          <p> Country music scholars generally overlook the role that African-Americans played in the formation of this genre. Typically, scholars trace the birth of country music to the recording sessions that record producer and talent scout Ralph Peer held in Bristol, Tennessee, in 1927. However, the origins of country music go back much further and owe a great deal to African-American musicians, some known and some anonymous and unheralded. The banjo, field hollers, and gospel music are examples of country genre staples that are rooted in the African-American experience. Moreover, some of the “stars” of country music learned their trade from African-American musicians. Rufus “Tee Tot” Payne, for instance, educated Hank Williams. In addition to jazz, gospel, and the blues, country music now clearly needs to be included in the list of musical genres that have an African-American lineage. </p>

          <p> Face perception is the mind’s ability to recognize and register another visage. It plays a significant role in social interactions. Through it we distinguish the familiar from the strange and formulate nuanced readings of people’s moods and characters. However, controversy surrounds the process of face perception. Psychologists argue that it involves a series of stages: Individuals recognize physical features, make broad inferences regarding gender and age, and finally recall meaningful information regarding the face they perceive, such as a name. Cognitive neuroscientists, on the other hand, posit the idea that face perception works through analogy: The mind has an inherent ability to connect similar objects. While the exact process of face perception is still unclear, evidence suggests that it involves a specific set of skills and that the fusiform gyrus, a part of the brain, is necessary for it to occur. </p>

In the first paragraph the author states that some people had assumed that schools that were freed from rules and regulations (such as charter schools) would revolutionize education. In the second paragraph the author states that those who study educational reform have found that charter schools did not in fact have a revolutionary impact on education—either for better or worse—although students who attend charter schools sometimes do not seem to do as well academically. In the last paragraph the author talks about the challenges that schools face in general, be they charter schools or traditional schools. Choice (A) gets closest to summarizing the entire passage.

          <p> It has frequently been argued that freeing schools from the rigid rules, regulations, and statutes that have traditionally fettered them would have a revolutionary effect on academic achievement. For instance, it has been suggested that schools embodying this idea could develop more effective teaching methods that could then be replicated in other schools. Charter schools—public schools that operate under a contract, or “charter”—were given just such an opportunity beginning in 1991, when Minnesota passed the first charter school law. At that time, many critics warned of deleterious rather than beneficial effects that such freewheeling schools could have on the academic achievement of students. Thus, while public opinion differed concerning the social desirability of charter schools, most agreed that there would be a pronounced effect. </p>
          <p> Surprisingly, educators who study educational reform now seriously question the degree to which charter schools have made an impact. They conclude that freedom from many of the policies and regulations affecting traditional public schools and the concomitant control over decisions that guide the day-to-day affairs of the school have not resulted in equally dramatic changes in students’ academic performance. In some states, charter schools are less likely to meet state performance standards than traditional public schools. It is, however, impossible to know whether this difference is due to the performance of the schools, the prior achievement of the students, or some other factor. </p>
          <p> Metrics for educational accountability have changed considerably in the past decade, moving increasingly to performance as measured by state mandated tests of individual student achievement. Fundamentally, however, the challenging conditions under which schools operate, be they traditional or charter, have changed little: the struggle for resources, low pay for teachers, accountability to multiple stakeholders, and the difficulty of meeting the educational requirements of children with special needs all persist. </p>

            <p>The important clues in this sentence are the words <em>cloudy</em> and <em>semi-transparent</em>, both of which describe the inner workings of the jellyfish. Choice (A) could be tempting because a jellyfish tentacle could definitely be caustic, but there’s no context for it. Eliminate it. You can eliminate choice (E) for the same reason. It seems logical, but isn’t actually supported by the text. Choice (C) is connected to the sentence because jellyfish are natatory creatures, but the blank is specifically describing the appearance of tentacles, not the jellyfish as a whole. Choice (B) has nothing to do with the sentence. Choices (D) and (F) both mean <em>loose, flowing, or see-through</em>, which is what you’re looking for.</p>

The sentence also tells you that <em>every clone trooper was reprogrammed to assassinate his Jedi master</em> This lets you know that there was a massive attack against the Jedi. So you could fill in the missing word with something like <em>serious injury</em> or <em>really bad experience</em> You can eliminate choices (B) and (F) because those are going in the wrong direction.

This is further supported with the clues that tell you the economy is not suited to <em>celebrities</em> who get paid <em>$15 to $20 million</em>, but to another kind of actor who <em>commands far less per picture</em> So put something in the blank like <em>unknown</em> or <em>new</em> You can eliminate choices (A) and (B) because those two answers would describe the A-list celebrities. Choice (E) also fits more with the A-listers because they’re the ones who would be expensive. Choice (F) doesn’t fit with anything in the sentence.
