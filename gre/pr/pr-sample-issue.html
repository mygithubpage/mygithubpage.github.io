      <h4>Strategies</h4>

      <h5>Key Terms</h5>
      <p>For this prompt, the key terms are <em></em>beauty, true, exceptional</em>, and <em>commonplace</em>. We need to think about how we’re going to use these terms in our essay. For example, what is <em>true beauty?</em> Do we want that to mean just natural beauty or can we consider man-made objects? As for the word <em>beauty</em>, do we want to limit our discussion to artistic beauty such as paintings and sculptures, or should we consider poems and literature as well? Should we discuss only natural beauty, such as stars and flowers, or should we consider personal beauty as well, such as models and GRE instructors? For this essay, let’s include both natural objects and man-made artistic feats, but leave out personal beauty.</p>

      <h5>Opposite Side</h5>
      <p>For this prompt, the opposite side of the argument would be something along the lines of “True beauty is found not in the commonplace, but in the exceptional.” Note that there is no right answer to the prompt; either side is valid. So if you find the opposite of the statement more convincing, that’s fine. As long as you can support your position with some relevant examples, it doesn’t matter what position you take on the prompt.</p>

      <h5>Examples</h5>
      <p> Here are some examples that might work for our sample topic: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa</b></li>
        <li><b>Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris</b></li>
        <li><b>Niagara Falls</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p> While you certainly may feel that your boyfriend or girlfriend is the most beautiful person in the world, that sort of personal example won’t be as effective as a more academic or global example. Use personal examples only when specifically instructed to by the prompt or as a last resort.</p>

      <h5>Separate Examples</h5>
      <p><b>Pro</b>: natural wonders; <b>Con</b>: Mona Lisa, Notre Dame. Based on some of the examples we’ve come up with, it looks like we’d be better off supporting the idea that “True beauty is found not in the commonplace, but in the exceptional.” While natural wonders like sunsets and flowers are pretty commonplace, we’ve come up with a lot more exceptional examples. And it looks like we could even argue that it is the exceptional natural wonders, such as Niagara Falls, that are truly beautiful.</p>

      <h5>Establish the Topic</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Rhetorical Questions:</b>
          <p><i></i>Where does true beauty lie, in the exceptional or in the commonplace?</i></p>
          <p><i>Do we find the exceptional more beautiful or the commonplace?</i></p>
          <p><i>Can we find beauty only in rare, exceptional instances or does it truly lie all around us?</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Famous Quotations:</b>
          <p><i>“Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty,” or so said the romantic poet John Keats.</i></p>
          <p><i>A common saying is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Anecdote:</b>
          <p><i>It is said that Cézanne, the famed French painter, was so concerned with the beauty of his paintings that he would destroy any of his works that he felt was flawed.</i></p>
          <p><i>The Romantic poet John Keats was so struck by the beauty of Chapman’s translation of Homer’s work that he wrote a poem about it.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fact/Statistic:</b>
          <p><i>A recent scientific study showed that the faces that people find the most beautiful are those that are the most symmetrical.</i></p>
          <p><i>Psychologists have demonstrated that people’s responses to certain phenomena are based on certain innate mechanisms in the brain.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Definition:</b>
          <p><i><b>Beauty, by definition, is that which moves us or impacts us significantly.</b></i></p>
          <p><i>The “exceptional” typically refers to those things that stand out, which is also a plausible definition for beauty.</i></p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Preview the issue</h5>
      <p><i>While some people can find beauty in the most common of places, true beauty is found only in the exceptional.</i></p>
      <p><i><b>Some would argue that beauty is found everywhere, from the flowers to the stars, but others would state that true beauty is found only in rare, special instances.</b></i></p>
      <p><i>Despite the assertions of many that beauty is everywhere, true beauty is found only in exceptional cases.</i></p>
      <p><i>Although one might argue that many commonplace things are beautiful, it is the exceptional things that possess true beauty.</i></p>

      <h5>Present the thesis</h5>
      <p><i>I believe that beauty is truly found in the exceptional, not in the commonplace, because if common things were beautiful, the very word would lose its meaning.</i></p>
      <p><i>In my view, beauty is found in the exceptional, not in the commonplace, because only exceptional things really stand out as special in our minds.</i></p>
      <p><i>It is clear that true beauty is not to be found in the commonplace but in the exceptional. On closer inspection, even so-called common objects that people consider beautiful are actually exceptional.</i></p>
      <p><i><b>After weighing the evidence, it is certain that beauty is the province of the exceptional, not the commonplace. People find true beauty in things that they rarely experience, not the things they experience every day.</b></i></p>

      <h5>Transition/Topic Sentence</h5>
      <p>The important point is that each sentence introduces the example and reminds the reader of the purpose of the example, which in this case is to support the notion of beauty as exceptional.</p>
      <p><i>One example of beauty found in the exceptional is Leonardo da Vinci’s</i> Mona Lisa.</p>
      <p><i>A second instance in which true beauty lies not in the commonplace but in the exceptional is Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.</i></p>
      <p><i>Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa is surely one of the most exceptional, and beautiful, paintings ever created.</i></p>
      <p><i>Consider the beauty of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, a building that is in no way commonplace.</i></p>
      <p><i><b>Like da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris is an exceptional, and exceptionally beautiful, object.</b></i></p>

      <h5>Explain the Example</h5>
      <p><i>Like da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris is an exceptional, and exceptionally beautiful, object. Churches and cathedrals line the streets of most major cities in Western Europe, but few possess the renown of Notre Dame. Notre Dame is a stunning example of gothic architecture, famous for the flying buttresses that adorn the sides of the building. The cathedral also has rows and rows of beautiful sculptures recessed into the walls, as well as a gorgeous central stained-glass window. These features make Notre Dame one of the most beautiful cathedrals in the world. Compared to a common church or cathedral, Notre Dame is truly awe-inspiring; Victor Hugo used the building as the backdrop for his magnificent book The Hunchback of Notre Dame and thousands of tourists travel untold miles to view the cathedral. That sort of beauty is not possessed by just any church on the corner.</i></p>
      <p>This is a stronger body paragraph because it is more explicit in its discussion of the thesis. The author notes that churches and cathedrals are fairly common, but then argues that Notre Dame stands out as an exceptional cathedral. The author concludes the paragraph by showing how Notre Dame is more beautiful than any typical church. Just as the topic of the essay should be clear from the introduction, the thesis should be clear from each body paragraph.</p>

      <h5>Summary Main Points</h5>
      <p><i><b>In conclusion, it’s clear that true beauty is found not in the commonplace, but in the exceptional. The Mona Lisa and Notre Dame Cathedral are both exceptional examples of fairly commonplace things and it is these exceptions that are noted as truly beautiful. If anything, the commonplace serves only as a contrast to what true beauty really is.</b></i></p>
      <p><i>Ultimately, beauty lies in the exceptional, not the commonplace. While paintings and churches are fairly commonplace, only a small few of them, such as the Mona Lisa or Notre Dame, truly reach the heights of beauty. It is in these exceptions that we find real beauty.</i></p>
      <p><i>The examples above all support the idea that we find true beauty in exceptional cases, not in commonplace ones. Common things may seem at first glance to be beautiful, but once we compare these commonplace examples to the truly exceptional ones, we see that the exceptional ones are truly beautiful.</i></p>

      <h4>Sample Response</h4>
      <p>Beauty, by definition, is that which moves us or impacts us significantly. Some would argue that beauty is found everywhere, from the flowers to the stars. But others would state that true beauty is found only in rare, special instances. After weighing the evidence, it is certain that beauty is the province of the exceptional, not the commonplace. People are moved most by things that they rarely experience, not the things they experience every day.</p>
      <p>Those who would argue that true beauty is everywhere might point to the beauty of a flower, or the starlit night. These experiences are certainly common, but do they show that true beauty is commonplace? Flowers might be considered beautiful, but how often does a person stop to look at or appreciate every flower? Flowers are so common that in many cases, they are ignored or viewed as nothing special. However, on those rare occasions—exceptional occasions, one might say—when we want to commemorate an event or express emotion, we notice the beauty of flowers. Thus, it is not the commonplace flower that strikes us as beautiful, but the exceptional situations themselves that move us to appreciate the flower.</p>
      <p>Now consider the exceptional. Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa is surely one of the most exceptional, and beautiful, paintings ever created. Few people who view the painting are not moved by the sheer beauty of it, and the Mona Lisa is instantly recognized as a masterpiece of art. And yet, there have been literally millions of paintings produced in human history. Is every single one of them beautiful? Does every one of those paintings have the impact that da Vinci’s does? Of course not. In order to find beauty, we must separate the exceptional cases from the common ones. True beauty is such because it stands out from the masses of the average and pedestrian.</p>
      <p>Like da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris is an exceptional, and exceptionally beautiful, object. Churches and cathedrals line the streets of most major cities in Western Europe, but few possess the renown of Notre Dame, one of the most beautiful cathedrals in the world. Compared to a common church or cathedral, Notre Dame is truly awe-inspiring; Victor Hugo used the building as the backdrop for his magnificent book The Hunchback of Notre Dame and thousands of tourists travel untold miles to view the cathedral. That sort of beauty is not possessed by just any church on the corner.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, it’s clear that true beauty is found not in the commonplace, but in the exceptional. The Mona Lisaand Notre Dame Cathedral are both exceptional examples of fairly commonplace things and it is these exceptions that are noted as truly beautiful. If anything, the commonplace serves only as a contrast so that we can understand what true beauty really is.</p>
