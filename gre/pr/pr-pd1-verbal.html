            <p>The blank describes what <em>the couple thought</em> about <em>the values represented in traditional services</em>. The clue is <em>modern</em>. The transition word <em>more</em> indicates that the word for the blank is an opposite of the clue, so use “old-fashioned” as a word for the blank. Choices (A), (D), and (E)—<em>bigoted, ineloquent, somber</em>—can be eliminated because they don’t match “old-fashioned.” For (C), while something that is <em>dogmatic</em> may be old-fashioned, the word means a belief that is established, which may not be old-fashioned, so eliminate (C). The correct answer is (B), <em>archaic</em>.</p>
