For the second blank, you need something like <em>making worse</em>, because you know that the people are even angrier; <em>exacerbating</em> is the best fit.

          <p> “Hydrothermal vent” is the term that scientists use to describe a crack in a planet’s surface from which geothermally heated water emerges. Because these vents are common in places that are volcanically active, they are plentiful on Earth. While the most famous hydrothermal vent is probably the geyser at Yellowstone National Park in the United States, there are several different types of vents, existing both on land and underwater. Black Smokers, for instance, are a common type of submarine vent. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration first discovered these in the vicinity of the Galapagos Islands in 1977. Underwater vents such as these form when water that has been heated by magma beneath the earth’s crust exits through cracks in the ocean floor. Scientists are interested in these vents primarily for their ability to host biologically dense communities in areas that are otherwise hostile to life. Studies show that Chemosynthetic archaea, a life form similar to bacteria, allows these areas to support such diverse organisms as clams and shrimp. Black Smokers are also visually striking. Minerals in the water that emerge from the earth’s crust crystallize around each vent to create their distinctive black chimney-like formations. </p>
          <p> While on a vessel exploring the Atlantis Massif in the mid-Atlantic Ridge, scientists recently discovered a completely new kind of hydrothermal system, which they dubbed “Lost City.” Here, a “forest” of white limestone pillars rises 180 feet above the sea floor. There are several important differences that distinguish the hydrothermal vents in Lost City from the more familiar Black Smokers. The heat and fluid flow at Lost City is driven by the intermingling of seawater and mantle rocks on the sea floor, rather than by hot magma. As these fluids mix with magnesium-rich sea water, they deposit calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide, thereby creating the stunning white structures of Lost City. The fluids here are also much cooler (less than 100 degrees Celsius) and are composed of substances and gases that are different from those of Black Smokers. For instance, the fluids here have high pH content and contain significant amounts of hydrogen and methane gas. </p>
          <p> The discovery of Lost City is still a fairly recent one, and scientists currently have more questions than answers. However, they hope that the insights they gain from this study will provide information that will lead to a better understanding of some of the earliest hydrothermal systems on earth and the life they supported. </p>

            <p>To hone in on the correct sentence, use lead words to find the general part of the passage which likely holds the answer to the question. In this case, the words <em>Black Smokers</em> leads you to the first paragraph. The question asks you <em>why</em> the biologists’ curiosity is piqued, so the sentence you are looking for is explanatory and refers to the value of the Black Smokers. The sentence beginning with <em>Scientists are interested…</em> is an answer to a <em>why</em> question, and you can make the link between <em>biologists</em> in the question and <em>biologically</em> in the sentence.</p>

Paragraph one also states that <em>scientists are interested in these vents primarily for their ability to host biologically dense communities in areas that are otherwise hostile to life</em> Since the rest of this paragraph is talking about the Black Smokers, this statement must mean that Black Smokers do <em>host biologically dense communities</em>, supporting choice (C).</p>

Simultaneously, the paintings boast an incredible mélange of the artistic traditions of prior masters and movements—such as a preoccupation with <em>terribilitas</em> from Michelangelo; a flair for color from Titian; and power, strength, and exuberance from Rubens—all underlain by the harmony and balance of classical artists and tinted with the Baroque.

            <p><strong>
 C</strong>The painting in the question is mentioned in the first sentence of the passage: <em>The paintings of Eugene Delacroix are as political, complex, tumultuous, and vivid as the life of Lord Byron, who inspired some of Delacroix’s best works, such as</em> Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi <em>and</em> Scènes des massacres de Scio. Therefore, Lord Byron inspired the painting in question, so choice (C) is correct. Choice (A) is a painting that was also inspired by Byron but is not the inspiration for the painting in the question. Choices (B), (D), and (E) are all mentioned elsewhere in the passage, but do not answer the question asked.</p>

Choices (A) and (D) give synonymous meanings, but nothing in the sentence supports the idea that Eileen gained weight.

Choices (E) and choice (F) are synonyms, but aren’t supported by the sentence. The recesses may be <em>empty</em>, but, again, that can’t be supported by the sentence; eliminate choice (A). <em>Cacophonous</em> means having a harsh or discordant sound, so choice (B) wouldn’t make sense in a room where the agents’ <em>ears were attuned to the slightest disturbance</em></p>

 A</strong> and <strong>B</strong></p>
            <p>The text tells you that the man is <em>anxious to avoid</em> a label, so his actions must contrast with the label he is trying to avoid. He wants to <em>present a frugal picture</em>, so he must be saving money. Therefore, the missing word must mean something like <em>reckless spender</em> Choices (C) and (E) could be attractive if you miss the contrast between the clue and the blank; these words mean <em>stingy person</em> and are opposite of what you need. Choices (D) and (F) are synonyms, but there aren’t any clues in the sentence that indicate the man is seeking pleasure. That leaves choices (A) and (B), both of which mean <em>wasteful spender</em> and make them the best answers.</p>

Both <em>ebullient</em> and <em>effusive</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (B) and (F). <em>Raffish</em> and <em>showy</em> could describe a pirate, but there’s no context to support that pair of synonyms, so eliminate choices (A) and (D).</p>

            <p>You know from the clue that <em>human sacrifices were ubiquitous</em>, so the act was familiar to all the tribes. The text sets up a contrast between the <em>Mayans</em> and the <em>neighboring tribes</em> in terms of their sacrificing. The trigger word <em>while</em> signals that the missing word goes in the opposite direction of the clue, and it must mean making the other tribes <em>uncomfortable</em> Eliminate choices (B) and (E) because those words are positive. Choice (D), <em>expatiated</em>, means <em>speak about in detail</em> and has nothing to do with the context of the sentence. Despite its topical relevance, choice (A) doesn’t contrast with the ubiquity of the sacrifices, nor does the context support the Mayans confining all the other tribes.
