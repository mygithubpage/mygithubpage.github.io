            <p><strong>A</strong>In the first paragraph the author notes that some readers categorize Kingston as a great Asian-American writer. The author follows this statement by referencing examples in her writing that support the contention, so the best answer is choice (A). The other choices are not supported by the passage.

          <p> Some readers categorize Maxine Hong Kingston as a great Asian-American writer, a classification that is ultimately too narrow for her body of work. However, the subject matter of Kingston’s novels and autobiographies espouses the Asian immigrant experience, as the following characters suggest: immigrant laborers in California and Hawaii, railroad laborers, and Chinese doctors. In natural harmony with her choice of subject matter are the personal sensibilities of a first-generation American writer who endeavors to explain her mother’s alien sensibility and her relationship with her silent, angry father. </p>
          <p> Kingston’s Asian influences are present in another type of work, Chinese myths in the guise of “talk stories.” A character in her novel Tripmaster Monkey is based on Sun Wu Kong, a mythical Chinese figure. In response to this work, Herbert Gold notes that the author “invigorates her novel with an avid personal perspective, doing what the novel is supposed to do—she brings us the news of the world and makes magic of it.” </p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong></p>
            <p>In the first paragraph the movement is described as a <em>subtle rebellion</em>, so the author sees literature as something that can be used as a protest as stated in choice (A). Choice (B) also works because the text tells you that while <em>seventeenth-century France was characterized by political intrigue and violence</em>, it also tells you that that same instability <em>reawakened French proclivities for cultural expression</em> and that by the time Louis XIV took the throne, society was <em>primed for the reestablishment of the arts</em> Therefore, prior to the unrest of the seventeenth-century, the French had more involvement with the arts. Choice (C) can be eliminated because the wording is too strong and inclusive; literature was a form of protest available, but you do not know that it was the <em>only</em> form of protest.</p>

          <p><em>Préciosité</em>, “preciousness,” or the manifestation of the baroque in literature, is often dismissed as a “feminine concoction,” mocked by Molière and thought to be ridiculous by modern standards. Preferring appearance to substance and excess to moderation, baroque expression is given to wild exaggeration and purple description. However, when one considers its historical context, the movement can be seen as a subtle rebellion by an otherwise powerless sex against its restrictive society. </p>
          <p> Crippled and stunned from a series of religious wars, seventeenth-century France under Louis XIII was characterized by political intrigue and violence. Escaping the crude court, a group of cultured and educated ladies met to discuss—in a fantastically embellished and witty manner—literature, art, and philosophy. They rejected the predominant emphasis on vulgarity and sought the elevation of <em>l’éducation</em>, or “manners” they considered essential to society. More salons followed, and these <em>précieuses</em> (literally, “precious ones”) produced works of literature that are still widely read, such as novels, essays, and poems that elevated the ideal of courtly, or Platonic, love with an emphasis on sensuality and scrupulous rules of behavior. </p>
          <p> Though men scoffed at their wives’ pretensions, baroque literature as a reaction to political instability reawakened French proclivities for cultural expression. When Louis XIV ascended to the throne in 1661, French society was primed for the reestablishment of the arts. Baroque ideals served important roles regarding the criticism of the political situation and the influence of cultural trends. Louis XIV’s peace provoked the cultural pendulum to swing to the other direction, ushering in a neo-classical movement that elevated simplicity and minimalism. It is surely no coincidence that it was the performance of “Les Précieuses Ridicules” (“The Conceited Ladies”), Moliere’s play mocking <em>préciosité</em>, that first gained him wide acclaim and established him as the preeminent father of French theater. </p>

        <div id="passage3" class="passage">
          <p> The mid-nineteenth century witnessed two major wars on U.S. soil: the Mexican-American War and the Civil War. That Abraham Lincoln would commit the country to civil war appears to require little explanation, since he endorsed the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the young nation. However, Lincoln’s disdain for the Mexican-American War, which was ostensibly fought to keep Texas in the Union, requires some examination. After all, Lincoln’s swift military response to the Southern secessionists at the beginning of the Civil War illustrates that Lincoln would not shrink from battle if the war could ensure a united country. Perhaps Lincoln’s resistance to the Mexican-American War can best be seen in light of his sincere belief that President Polk had overstepped his constitutional boundaries in declaring war against Mexico, a sovereign nation. In this light, it is perhaps ironic that Lincoln’s own presidential legacy includes a greater centralization of federal government power. </p>

 B</strong> and <strong>D</strong></p>
            <p>The sentence tells you that the selection of a <em>fresh cause</em> happens <em>every five years</em>, so the blank must refer to a word such as <em>habit</em> or <em>custom</em><em>Ambivalence</em> would indicate that the agencies are not sure about taking this action, and <em>callousness</em> indicate a lack of caring. <em>Wariness</em> would indicate that they are <em>hesitant</em> to change the cause. <em>Affectation</em> is tricky because it sounds similar to <em>affection,</em> which might make it sound like a good choice. However, <em>affectation</em> actually means <em>artificiality</em>, which is not the meaning you need. Choices (B) and (D) are both good substitutes for <em>custom</em> are produce equivalent, appropriate sentences.</p>

Friends who would do that are not very good friends, so you’re looking for a word that means <em>not loyal</em><em>Squeamish</em> describes someone who becomes uncomfortable easily, usually around things that are unpleasant to the senses (blood, rodents, etc.). While the friends may be <em>uncomfortable</em> in the doctor’s presence, that’s not why they abandoned him. <em>Orthodox</em> and <em>stodgy</em> describe people who adhere rigidly to convention. These words describe the <em>medical establishment</em>, not the friends.
