            <p><strong> initiative</strong> and <strong>strive</strong></p>
            <p>Lisa is <em>frustrated</em> by her husband’s lack of something, so that something must be good. <em>Lassitude</em> is the quality of being <em>lazy or lacking in energy</em>, which is not a good quality. <em>Eloquence</em>, or <em>being skilled in the use of language</em> is a positive quality, but the lack of <em>eloquence</em> would not likely be something that a wife would find frustrating. <em>Initiative</em> means <em>ambition</em>, a positive quality for a person to have. To <em>motivate</em> a person who lacks <em>initiative</em>, one must encourage him to try to do things. To <em>mitigate</em> means <em>to make a problem better</em>, which isn’t quite what you’re looking for. To <em>invigorate</em> means <em>to give life to something</em>, and there’s no indication in the sentence that the husband is expected to give life to anything. To <em>strive</em> means <em>to aim for</em>; a person with a lack of <em>initiative</em> should try to <em>aim for</em> things, so this word is a good fit for the blank.</p>

            <p><strong> remote</strong> and <strong>corroboration</strong></p>
            <p>The astronomers have discovered objects <em>at the edges of the universe</em>, so you need a word that is consistent with that clue. <em>Paranormal</em> means <em>beyond the scope of scientific understanding</em>; it is usually used to describe supernatural things like aliens and ghosts. <em>Viscous</em> means <em>fluid</em> or <em>sticky</em>, so that word is definitely not consistent with the blank. <em>Remote</em> means <em>distant</em>, which would describe objects <em>at the edges of the universe</em>. The quasars have shown scientists something about <em>the existence of stars</em>, so blank (ii) must mean something like <em>proof</em>. <em>Distortion</em> means <em>changing</em>, so that word is not consistent with the blank. <em>Intuition</em> is a feeling that something is true, but not actual <em>proof</em>. Corroboration means <em>proof</em>, and so it is a good fit for blank (ii).</p>

Located between the stratosphere (the maximum altitude that airplanes can achieve) and the thermosphere (the minimum altitude of spacecraft), the mesosphere is poorly understood and little explored. The most significant feature of the mesosphere is the various tides and waves that propagate up from the troposphere and stratosphere. The dissipation of these waves is largely responsible for propelling the mesosphere around the globe. These wave patterns are further affected when gas particles in the mesosphere collide with meteoroids, producing spectacular explosions, which usually generate enough heat to consume the meteor before it can fall to earth. The conflagration leaves behind traces of iron and other metals and fuels the atmospheric tides radiating outward from the mesosphere. </p>

          <p> Although multi-organ transplants have become more common, scientists and surgeons continue to face the ineluctable obstacle of time. Current donor organ preservation times hover around five to six hours. Because of the complicated tissue-matching process, oftentimes organs are unable to reach their beneficiaries, wasting valuable, viable organs. However, scientists are hopeful that a certain substance, called the Hibernation Induction Trigger (HIT), will extend the life of a potential transplant organ. </p>
          <p> HIT is an opiate-like substance found in the blood of hibernating animals. Previous experiments have shown that opioids act as an autoperfusion block, preventing blood from flowing through the lymphatic system to organs, a phenomenon known as ischemia. In a preliminary experiment, an infusion of plasma with the Delta opioid delayed hemorrhaging in certain laboratory animals. When this arresting of activity was applied to the transplantation of organs, physicians reported preservation times up to 15 hours, a more than two-fold increase over standard conservation. </p>
          <p> Scientists have extrapolated from these findings, further identifying the opioid DADLE as integral to triggering the hibernation process. Infusing HIT-molecule-containing plasma from hibernating woodchucks into canine lungs increased preservation times more than three-fold from previous findings. This experiment suggests that, should a potential donor organ be infused with these trigger molecules before the organ is harvested, the organ would remain transplantable for up to 45 hours, greatly increasing the chance for doctors to find a suitable recipient. </p>
          <p> Though these results are exciting, they do nothing to increase survival rates from an organ transplant operation, which currently hover at 60 percent over four years, because patients are still susceptible to infection and rejection. Scientists are a long way from declaring HIT-molecules a safe and consistent method of organ preservation. Still, other areas of science have taken an interest in this research. NASA, for example, is considering the implications of human hibernation for deep space travel. </p>

          <p> It might seem illogical that the development of modern currency rests on a scientific discovery, but the invention of the “touchstone” allowed ancient societies to create a standard by which valuable metals could be judged. In its most basic form, a touchstone is any dark, finely grained stone upon which soft metals leave traces. When rubbed, a process known as “probing,” precious metal alloy cleaves to the stone, leaving a stripe. The color of the stripe (which reveals the percentage of its content that is base metal) can then be compared to a stripe of a known grade of standard alloy. Despite its primitiveness, this probing process allowed merchants to examine alloys quickly and with reasonable certainty. Though civilizations were using gold and silver currencies as early as 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, coins were easily forged or diluted with less valuable metals, such as tin or lead. The invention and popularization of the touchstone ensured that pure gold and silver could become a standard expression of value. </p>

          <p> Women played a substantial role in the furthering of the Polish art song in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. One notable woman from this time period was Maria Szymanowska, who was both a concert pianist and a composer. </p>
          <p> Szymanowska was a member of the Warsaw Music Society who contributed pieces to a cycle entitled Historical Songs. Her songs are by far the most creative and individualistic of the cycle. In addition, Szymanowska composed more than one hundred other pieces, mostly for the piano, including six romances. </p>
          <p> Her songs most resemble French romances, and she also employs Polonaise rhythms in two of her songs. In all her works, the melodic line is technically superior. She employs idiomatic keyboard writing, wide chord-spacing, broad cantilenas, and interesting modulations. She also uses the most compelling registers of the instrument and pianistic keys. Her romances are on par with those of Beethoven, Schubert, and Mozart. In fact, Szymanowska was praised by her contemporaries, such as Schumann, who lauded her etudes. Her piano playing was frequently equated to that of Hummel, though Szymanowska’s was said to be more ethereal. Thus, she is a progenitor of Chopin in both piano technique and composition. </p>
          <p> Female contributors to the development of Polish music have been chiefly ignored. From the meager records which have been preserved, it is incontrovertible that Polish women were, in fact, playing, instructing, and writing music as early as the fifteenth century. However, patriarchal societal structures have precluded adequate documentation about, and preservation of, their work. Unless changes take place, human society will be made poorer for its inability to recognize the expertise and inventiveness of these women. </p>

            <p><em>Gainsaid</em> means <em>contradicted</em>, so the words that will fill in the blank will roughly mean <em>transparent</em>. <em>Abstruse</em> and <em>cryptic</em> both mean <em>difficult to understand</em>, so eliminate choices (B) and (E). Neither <em>aesthetic</em>, which means <em>concerned with beauty</em>, nor <em>recalcitrant</em>, which means <em>resistant to authority</em>, fits the meaning you need; eliminate choices (D) and (F). Both <em>perspicuous</em> and <em>manifest</em> can mean <em>easily understood</em>, so choices (A) and (C) produce logical sentences with the same meaning.</p>

            <p>To call the area _______ was perhaps hyperbolic; while it was certainly quaint, the presence of mining equipment was decidedly imposing.</p>

            <p><strong>      D</strong>  and <strong>F</strong></p>
            <p><em>Hyperbolic</em> means <em>exaggerated</em>. The correct answers will be words that mean something a bit more extreme than <em>quaint</em> that also contrast with the imposition of mining equipment. <em>Germane</em> means <em>relevant to</em>, and doesn’t fit here; eliminate choice (A). <em>Gentrified</em> refers to an area that was previously owned or occupied by poor people and is transformed by more wealthy people. Although it is relevant to the subject, it is a trap that doesn’t fit with the rest of the sentence, so choice (B) should be eliminated. <em>Aplomb</em> (self-confidence) and <em>rancorous</em> (greatly hostile) are similarly irrelevant to this question, so eliminate choices (C) and (E). <em>Bucolic</em> means <em>idyllically pastoral</em> or <em>rural,</em> and <em>quiescent</em> means <em>quiet</em> or <em>restful.</em> Plugging either into the blank produces a sentence that is congruent, making choices (D) and (F) the best answers.</p>

            <p><strong>T</strong>he sentence says that <em>local</em> commercials are a <em>tonic</em> or “cure” for <em>homogeneity</em> or “sameness”, so a good word would be <em>quirks</em> or <em>individualities.</em> Check the answers.

            <p>The <em>spending</em>, combined with <em>bad investments</em>, left the boxer <em>insolvent</em>, so you need something like <em>excessive</em> for the blank. Both <em>parsimonious</em> and <em>penurious</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A) and (B). Neither <em>perfidious</em>, which means <em>disloyal,</em> nor <em>pugnacious</em>, which means <em>belligerent,</em> makes sense in the blank, so eliminate choices (C) and (F). Both <em>prodigal</em> and <em>profligate</em> can mean <em>excessive,</em> particularly in reference to <em>spending</em>, so choices (D) and (E) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>Since the blank refers to something delivered by a <em>poet or orator</em> and meant to <em>lavish praise</em>, you need something like <em>poem of praise</em> or <em>speech of praise</em>. Three of the choices are the wrong kind of writing: Both an <em>elegy</em> and a <em>jeremiad</em> express lamentation, and a <em>philippic</em> expresses condemnation, so eliminate choices (B), (D), and (E). A <em>compendium</em> is a brief summary, so eliminate choice (A). Both <em>encomium</em> and <em>panegyric</em> can mean <em>poem or speech of praise,</em> so choices (C) and (F) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>
