          <p>The societies in which shamanism has flourished have been small, relatively self-sufficient social systems which see themselves as coping directly with their natural worlds. Like all human beings, the members of such groups lived in a world of uncertainty. The presence of a person who could maintain contact with the cosmic forces of the universe directly, who could make sense of both the measured order of ordinary times and the catastrophes of drought, earthquake, or flood, was of incalculable value.</p>
          <p>More complex social systems tend to have "institutionalized" specialists who transmit information without explicit recourse to the supernatural. Such societies have priests and prophets, not shamans, at the overt level. But the line between shaman and prophet is tenuous. The prophet usually does not enjoy the legitimacy within his society that is granted the shaman. His is a voice crying in the wilderness, not that of the legitimate curer and philosopher. Despite these differences, the prophet can be seen as a kind of shaman, and thus the study of shamanism illuminates some of the obscurities in religious traditions.</p>

The correct answer must allow both facts to be true, and provide an explanation that incorporates both facts. Choice (A) can be eliminated as out of scope, as the passage refers to “shoppers in Arcadia County,” not people who live there. Choice (B) can be eliminated as out of scope, as “shoppers…who maintain a healthy weight” cannot help explain “overweight…shoppers.” Choice (D) is a reversal, as a decrease in the obesity rate would make the increase in overweight shoppers require additional explanation. Choice (E) is out of scope, as the passage refers to rising sales, and provides no indication that the desired foods are restricted to fruits and vegetables. The correct answer is (C).</p>

          <p>The importance of a well-balanced diet high in fiber and low in saturated fat is understood by most shoppers in Arcadia County. Moreover, food nutrition labels clearly display important nutritional information. As a result, sales of high-fiber foods in Arcadia County have risen dramatically during the last decade, while sales of foods high in saturated fat have dropped by a similar magnitude. Even so, during the last decade the number of shoppers in Arcadia County who are overweight has increased substantially.</p>

          <p>Some economists have argued that market regulation is antithetical to the ideal functioning of a democratic society because it interferes with the individual's right to make decisions in his own financial interest. In a regulated market, the citizen is not always at liberty to choose where or how to build his house or whom to hire for his business. If all individuals do not have complete freedom to make economic decisions purely with respect to their own self-interest, then a society is not a true democracy. Yet this perspective overlooks the fact that the democratic ideal encompasses two separate, but not mutually exclusive goals: 1) to ensure individual liberty and 2) to promote the overall health and well- being of the population. Some degree of market regulation may be necessary to fulfill the latter goal, for an individual's exercise of his own liberty can in some instances interfere with the liberty of others. </p>
