            <p>Because the stress tests are <em>supposed to reassure</em> the investors, the first blank must describe someone in need of reassurance, so something like <em>scared</em> or <em>nervous</em> would make sense; <em>timorous</em> is the best match.

          <p> Historically, sociologists have presumed that people will attribute certain characteristics to a member of a particular group when it is generally believed that most members of that group possess the characteristics in question. For sociologists Hepburn and Locksley, such social stereotyping has led to the broader question of whether people are cognizant of their own stereotyping behavior. Seemingly, if one knows that one holds a stereotypical notion such as “all members of a certain ethnic group are natural musicians,” then one might also be aware that the notion that “a particular musician of that ethnic group is a great musician” is a corollary of that stereotype. However, people are most aware of their stereotyping when they have no information. When given information that conforms to their beliefs and the individual case observed, people become less aware of their tendency to stereotype and therefore more likely to engage in stereotyping. </p>

            <p><strong>In his novels, McMurtry creates strong female characters, transmuting…</strong> The third paragraph discusses the differences between <em>the traditional Western formula</em> and <em>McMurtry</em> in their treatment of character. The main difference this paragraph focuses on is that the traditional Westerns feature mostly male characters, whereas McMurtry focuses on female characters. The identified sentence says that McMurtry’s creation of strong female characters folds in <em>deeper ideological insights</em> This is a good thing, suggesting that the author views this practice with a positive eye. The final sentence may be tempting, but it conveys the opinion of critics, not necessarily the author, and it doesn’t specifically address the issue of gender.</p>

        <div id="passage2" class="passage">
          <p> The literature of the American West ranges from lowbrow entertainment to great works of fiction. The extremes are obvious enough, but the middle tends to blur. The dime-store Western never aspired to be anything but entertainment. James Fenimore Cooper and Willa Cather, however, used themes of westward expansion in works clearly intended as highbrow literature. The novels of modern writer Larry McMurtry broke new ground: He took the Western and created a great piece of fiction, without changing its fundamental genre appeal or its accessibility to the general reader. </p>
          <p> As an example of his retooling of the Western genre, consider McMurtry’s themes. While the Western myth is fundamentally about resettlement to new lands, McMurtry’s novels combine elements of the Western myth with less traditional motifs: profound reluctance to face change, conflict between urbanization and the Western ideal, the importance of place, and the role of the land itself. While the traditional Western is rooted in the past, McMurtry’s themes combine nostalgia for that past with a sense of emptiness in the present and hopelessness for the future. </p>
          <p> Or consider McMurtry’s treatment of character. The traditional Western formula depicts mainly masculine characters and portrays them as both heroic and human. In his novels, McMurtry creates strong female characters, transmuting the conventional plot of the trials and dangers of the frontier by folding in deeper ideological insights. Critics rightly credit his novels with reshaping the Western genre, praising his work and its meticulous attention to the Western <em>mise en scène</em> as a subversive but sincere tribute to the American West. </p>

The subversive differences in McMurtry’s writing referenced throughout the passage are thus indicative of his ideology. The focus on the <em>dangerous nature of the Western frontier</em> is a characteristic of the traditional Western, not McMurtry’s Westerns, so choice (B) is not an indication of the ideology of McMurtry’s novels.</p>

            <p>All the sentence tells you about Bede is that he earned the epithet <em>venerable</em>, so something like <em>venerated</em> or <em>honored</em> would make sense in the blank. Both <em>defamed</em> and <em>reviled</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A) and (F). Neither <em>consoled</em>, which means <em>gave comfort to,</em> nor <em>mitigated</em>, which means <em>made less severe,</em> makes sense in the blank, so eliminate choices (B) and (E). Both <em>revered</em> and <em>esteemed</em> can mean <em>honored,</em> so choices (C) and (D) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>The sentence contrasts the <em>rules of etiquette</em> with <em>the detailed written regulations regarding play,</em> so you need something like <em>vague</em> or <em>unwritten</em> for the blank. Both <em>express</em> and <em>manifest</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (C) and (F). Be careful about <em>laconic</em>: It means using few words, but not unspoken, so eliminate choice (B). <em>Reclusive</em>, which means <em>withdrawn from society,</em> doesn’t make sense in the blank, so eliminate choice (E). Both <em>implicit</em> and <em>tacit</em> can mean <em>unwritten,</em> so choices (A) and (D) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>The trigger word <em>but</em> is key in this sentence because it denotes a reversal over time. Since you are told that <em>those who had fought for its ratification</em> were <em>discouraged</em>, the word <em>but</em> tells you they were once encouraged. Therefore, <em>auspiciously</em> and <em>promisingly</em> fit the blank as they tell the same story as encouraged. <em>Bleakly</em> and <em>unfavorably</em> tell the opposite story and are not correct. <em>Suspiciously</em> means distrustful and <em>ineffectually</em> means useless, and neither word fits the meaning of the blank.</p>
