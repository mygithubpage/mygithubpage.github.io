            <p>Start with the last blank because it is the easiest. The clue tells you that <em>the plaintiff’s case disintegrated</em> Therefore, the claims must have been shown to be false. <em>Facetious</em>, though somewhat negative, does not mean <em>false</em> but does not go far enough. <em>Unerring</em> goes in the opposite direction. <em>Specious</em> is the best match. The first blank is the easiest one to attempt next. The case fell apart when something happened to the witnesses’ credentials, so a good phrase for the first blank—which described the role of the witnesses in the plaintiff’s case—is “based on.” <em>Dependent on</em> is the only match. If the plaintiff’s claims were based on the witnesses, and the case fell apart, logically the witnesses must have been discredited somehow. A good word for the second blank—which describes what the court decided about the witnesses’ credentials—is <em>denied</em><em>Vindicated</em> goes in the opposite direction. <em>Repudiated</em> is the best match.</p>

            <p><strong>A</strong>The right answer to a main idea question will cover the entire passage. This passage describes three theories for the cause of the Permian mass extinctions: asteroid impact, volcanic eruption, and rising concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the earth’s oceans. The first two of these theories are shown to be problematic. All you are told about the third theory is that it can be tested. The answer that best covers all three theories is choice (A).</p>

        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p> Theorists are divided about the cause of the Permian mass extinctions. Some hypothesize that the impact of a massive asteroid caused a sudden disappearance of species. However, a look at the carbon-isotope record suggests that existing plant communities were struck down and re-formed several times. To produce such a pattern would require a succession of asteroid strikes thousands of years apart. Other theorists have proposed that volcanic explosions raised the CO<sub><span>2</span></sub> levels, leading to intense global warming. One problem with this theory is that it cannot explain the massive marine extinctions at the end of the Permian period. A new theory posits that rising concentrations of toxic hydrogen sulfide in the world’s oceans plus gradual oxygen depletions in the surface waters caused the extinctions. Fortunately, this theory is testable. If true, oceanic sediments from the Permian period would yield chemical evidence of a rise in hydrogen sulfide-consuming bacteria. </p>

 The oceanic sediment is geologically inactive.</p>

 The oceanic sediments contain many chemicals more toxic than simple hydrogen sulfide.</p>

          <div class="explanation" data-answer="B">
            <p><strong>B</strong>According to the passage, the hydrogen sulfide theory could be tested by checking <em>oceanic sediments from the Permian period</em> for evidence of the proliferation of certain bacteria. If, as choice (B) suggests, the Permian period can’t be distinguished from earlier periods, then it will be impossible to test for an increase in bacteria from that period. Choice (A), if anything, would strengthen the author’s argument by making the Permian period more distinct; choices (C), (D), and (E) go beyond the scope of the passage.</p>

 Whether conditions on Mars are conducive to human habitation is not the only issue that limits realistic consideration of terraforming.</p>

            <p>The final sentence of the passage indicates that transportation is a clear problem that limits consideration of terraforming to <em>mere conjecture</em>, so choice (A) is supported. Choice (B) is supported because the author is worried about the Martian atmosphere dehydrating again after the planet is made habitable. Choice (C), however, goes beyond the scope of the information presented in the passage: The previous existence of water and an atmosphere similar to that of earth does not necessarily mean that Mars hosted life.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="passage3" class="passage">
          <p> The controversial concept of terraforming, or changing a planet’s atmosphere to make it more habitable for humans, is still no more than a theoretical debate. However, the most recent data from two American Mars Rovers suggest that the terraforming of Mars may be more feasible than previously thought. The rovers found evidence of stratification patterns and cross bedding (indicating a history of sediment deposited by water) in rocks on the edges of craters, as well as chlorine and bromine, suggestive of a large body of salt water. If Mars once held water, it is possible that its atmosphere was at one time somewhat similar to Earth’s. Even if this theory were true, however, scientists would have to prevent a recurrence of the desiccation of the Martian atmosphere once it is made habitable, as well as endeavor to preserve any extant life. Of course, until a reliable method of transporting humans to Mars is developed, any possibility of terraforming is mere conjecture. </p>

          <div class="choices">
            <p>
 Scientists have devised a technique to provide a layer of carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, which would trap solar radiation and thus modify temperature.</p>
            <p>
 Mars has stronger solar winds than does Earth, thus, making it difficult to retain atmospheric gases.</p>
            <p>
 Mars’ core has cooled faster than Earth’s, and its temperature is much lower than Earth’s.</p>
            <p>
 Terraforming Mars is likely to have a galvanizing effect on Earth’s governments.</p>
            <p>
 Terraforming Mars is unlikely to disturb life on other planets, should it exist.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p><strong>A</strong>One of the major obstacles to terraforming Mars as mentioned in the passage is the lack of a life-sustaining atmosphere; if the carbon dioxide layer were able to retain atmospheric heat, terraforming would be more feasible. Thus, choice (A) is the best answer. Choice (B) makes terraforming less feasible; without an atmosphere it would be inhospitable to man. Choice (C) makes terraforming neither more nor less likely—the point of terraforming is to change the environment. The passage is not concerned with governments on Earth, making choice (D) incorrect. Choice (E) is incorrect because the passage is not concerned with other planets.</p>
