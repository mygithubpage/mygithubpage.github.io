            <p>The blank is describing the kind of <em>economic ripples</em> caused by <em>[t]he Erie Canal’s completion.</em> The clause after the semi-colon provides further insight into the sentence: <em>property values and industrial output…rose exponentially.</em> Therefore, these ripples could thus be described as significant or “large,” so use this word for the blank. Choice (A), <em>persistent,</em> is not a match for “large” so eliminate it. Choice (B), <em>invaluable</em> doesn’t quite mean “large,” and (C), <em>incredulous,</em> is nothing like “large” so eliminate (B) and (C). <em>[S]evere</em> might describe a significant economic effect, but that effect would be negative, not positive as implied here, so eliminate (D). Choice (E), <em>prodigious,</em> meaning impressively great or large, is a good match for “large.” The correct answer is (E).</p>

            <p>The blank is describing how <em>voters…respond to the levy of a new tax.</em> The clue in the sentence is the word <em>inured,</em> which means hardened to a negative situation. If <em>[v]oters</em> are <em>inured,</em> then their response <em>to the levy of a new tax</em> would not be strong. Thus the word in the blank could be “resignation.” Choice (A), <em>amazement,</em> is not a match for “resignation” so eliminate (A). Choice (B), <em>stolidity,</em> or lack of emotion, is a good match so keep (B). Choice (C), <em>exasperation,</em> may describe how voters feel generally towards politicians, but is not supported by the passage so eliminate (C). Choice (D), <em>alarm,</em> and (E), <em>perplexity,</em> are both poor matches for “resignation,” so eliminate both answer choices. The correct answer is (B).</p>

            <p>The blank is describing <em>when…it is desirable to expand the yield of a harvest.</em> The sentence provides further insight into this by stating that <em>it is desirable to expand…yield,</em> but only if there aren’t also certain <em>additions in time, exertion and other variable factors of production.</em> So, a word such as “similar” for the blank conveys the logic that expanded yield shouldn’t require expanded additions in time and other factors. Choice (A), <em>predestined,</em> is not a match for “similar” so eliminate (A). Choice (B), <em>commensurate,</em> is a good match for the blank so keep (B). Choice (C), <em>deliberate,</em> is not a match for the blank, so eliminate it. Choice (D), <em>analogous</em> is close, but <em>commensurate</em> is more quantitative, so eliminate (D). While <em>indeterminate</em> or uncertain additions are certainly not desired, this choice doesn’t match “similar,” so eliminate (E). The correct answer is (B).</p>

            <p>Try working with the second blank first. The clue is “…when the increased popularity of dime novels, the expansion in the number of bookstores, and the introduction of the paperback made books….” Therefore, find a word for the second blank similar to <em>accessible</em><em>Attainable by</em> is the best choice.

            <p>If district boundaries are designed to <em>protect incumbents</em>—that is, those already in office—then <em>victory</em> for those incumbents should be close to <em>assured</em> or <em>inevitable</em><em>Ineluctable</em> is synonymous with these words. <em>Invidious</em> means “causing envy” and <em>plangent</em> means “full of lamentation,” neither of which is as well supported as the credited response. The second blank comes after a couple of transition words. The first is <em>Of course</em>, which might sound like the passage is continuing in the same direction, but here indicates a change of direction: The author is conceding that sometimes incumbents face challenges. The second, <em>Nevertheless</em>, also changes direction, meaning that the passage has returned to where it started, arguing that elections are essentially decided before they begin. That is what <em>merely denouement</em> means. <em>Seldom nugatory</em> means rarely inconsequential, which is the opposite of what the passage calls for; <em>remarkably</em><em>contentious</em> is wrong for the same reason, as that phrase would indicate that the general election is fiercely contested.</p>

            <p>The first blank describes a group of professors. The clue is that these professors “continue to insist that video games will never be a proper object of study.” The transition <em>While</em> also means that these professors are different from <em>the rising generation of more heterodox academics</em> So, a good word for the first blank is something like <em>orthodox</em> Of the answers, only <em>pedantic</em>, which means overly concerned with the formalisms of teaching, comes close to meaning <em>orthodox</em> The second blank describes how the rising generation regards the talk of the first group of professors. Since the rising generation is more heterodox, they would likely regard the view of the more orthodox professors as outdated. The word <em>antediluvian</em>—literally, before the flood—means extremely old-fashioned. <em>Pusillanimous</em> means cowardly, and <em>jejune</em> means vapid and immature, so eliminate these choices.</p>

            <p>The first blank refers to what some people believe about the human lifespan representing the <em>outer bounds of animal longevity</em> in relation to that of other animals. So, look for a word that means <em>marker</em><em>Demarcates</em> is the best fit, as <em>belies</em> means contradicts, and <em>antedates</em> means comes before. The second blank refers to the stories of musket balls being found in turtle shells and how some people <em>tend to dismiss tales</em> about turtles living a long time, so a word such as <em>questionable</em> would fit. <em>Apocryphal</em> means questionable, making it the best choice. The clue for the final blank is that some turtles <em>show(ing) no signs of aging even as they pass the two-century mark</em> so look for a word that works with <em>negligible</em> to create a phrase that means “not growing old.” <em>Senescence</em> means growing old and when combined with negligible, is a good fit for this clue.</p>

The last part of the sentence provides an additional clue: “failed to redress his inability to construct cogent prose” means that he doesn’t make sense. The blank must mean <em>ineffective</em>, so <em>inept</em> and <em>maladroit</em> are the correct answers. Nothing tells us how Francis feels, so <em>morose</em> won’t work. <em>Astute</em> is the opposite of what’s needed.

            <p>The main clues are that one twin is described as <em>sanguine</em>, the other <em>choleric</em>; even if you don’t know these words, the phrases “even in times of stress” and “angry outbursts” suggest that they are words used to describe <em>personality</em><em>Temperament</em> is a good synonym for <em>personality</em> While it is frequently used to mean comedy, <em>humor</em> can also mean personality, especially in conjunction with words such as <em>sanguine</em> and <em>choleric</em>, which derive from the ancient belief that temperament was shaped by the levels of different fluids, or humors, in a person’s body. The remaining choices don’t fit: <em>Environment</em> means one’s surroundings, while the other three words are concerned with the physical rather than the mental.</p>

            <p>The passage states, “Yet, to remember the man solely by his associations is to miss his importance to nineteenth-century American philosophy as a whole and to the Transcendental Movement in particular,” which suggests the author would agree with (A). In the second paragraph, the author refers to Alcott as a “visionary,” which means ahead of his time, so the author would agree with (B). In the last sentence, the author notes that Alcott believed that “a student’s intellectual growth was concomitant with his or her spiritual growth.” This rules out (C). In the second paragraph, the author refers to Alcott’s ideas as <em>polemical</em> at the time. <em>Polemical</em> means controversial, thereby implying that Alcott’s ideas were not universally accepted, which agrees with (D). The last paragraph of the passage praises Alcott as an erudite orator, a point that is made in direct contrast with his lack of skills as a writer. Therefore, (E) is not supported.</p>

          <p>Bronson Alcott is perhaps best known not for who he was, but for whom he knew. Indeed, Alcott’s connections were impressive by any standards: He was a close confidante of such luminaries as Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau. Yet, to remember the man solely by his associations is to miss his importance to nineteenth-century American philosophy as a whole and to the Transcendental Movement in particular. Admittedly, Alcott’s gift was not as a writer. His philosophical treatises have rightly been criticized by many as being ponderous, esoteric, and lacking focus.</p>
          <p>However, Alcott was an erudite orator, and it is in the text of his orations that one begins to appreciate him as a visionary. Most notably, Alcott advocated what were at the time polemical ideas on education. He believed that good teaching should be Socratic in nature and that a student’s intellectual growth was concomitant with his or her spiritual growth.</p>

            <p>Choice (B) is correct. The author states that taxonomic classifications should be used in conjunction with other information about the animal. In (B), the team uses both observed and accepted data, which would include classification. Choice (A) is incorrect because the scientists use only taxonomic information.

          <p><em>Echinosorex gymnura,</em> known colloquially as the moonrat or gymnure, is one of the many fascinating creatures that inhabit the jungles of Southeast Asia. A close relative of the hedgehog, the moonrat likewise belongs to the order <em>Insectivora</em> and the family <em>Erinaceidae</em>. However, the family then splits into the sub-family <em>Hylomyinae</em>, which contains three separate genera and eight distinct species. The appearance and habitat of the moonrat are actually far more similar to those of various members of the order <em>Rodentia</em>, though its eating habits are more in line with its fellow insectivores. Ultimately, the taxonomic classification of this animal is useful only when considered along with other information regarding the animal’s ecological niche.</p>

            <p>This is really asking for the conclusion of the argument. Choice (B) provides the conclusion. Remember that a properly drawn conclusion should pass the Why Test. Why would hiring a Chief Information Officer improve productivity? Because Chief Information Officers are like new business computer systems, which increase productivity for companies. For (A), because the actual function of a Chief Information Officer is never described in the argument, you cannot conclude anything about that function. Choice (C) contradicts the part of the passage that states “many businesses experience dramatic gains in productivity after installing a new computer system.” For (D), the argument provides no basis for comparing the efficiency of a Chief Information Officer and a new computer system. For (E), the difficulty of measuring the results is outside the scope of this argument.</p>

          <p>Business computer systems are designed to make workers more productive by automating a portion of the work that must be completed in a business process. As a result, the employee is free to perform more tasks that require human attention. Although productivity may be lost during a learning period, many businesses experience dramatic gains in productivity after installing a new computer system. While discussing the connection between productivity gains and computer systems, a well-respected business journal recently stated that the person who serves as the Chief Information Officer is the consummate business computer system.</p>

            <p>The conclusion is that the clothes washed at the Main Street Laundromat are cleaner than those washed at the Elm Street Laundromat because Main Street uses more water. The premise is that Joe’s clothes are cleaner when he does them at the Main Street Laundromat and that Main Street’s machines use more water per load. This is a causal argument. One way to strengthen a causal argument is to rule out an alternate cause. Choice (B) rules out different detergents as an alternate cause. Choice (A) is just a restatement of the conclusion.

 In 1991, most late-mail complaints were reported to the appropriate United States Postal Service office, whereas in 1964 most were not.</p>

 Even in a multiple-truck delivery system, certain letters will arrive late.</p>

The premise is that the rate of complaints increased and that there had been a change in the method of delivery. The argument is causal. Choice (A) weakens the argument by providing another cause for the increased rate: Today, the complaints are being reported to the right people. This answer choice leaves open the possibility that the actual number of complaints is unchanged from 1964, but explains why the rate of complaints has risen. For (B), whether any mail arrives late in a multiple-truck delivery system is out of scope. For (C), registered mail versus unregistered mail is out of scope. For (D), because the argument is referring to the rate of complaints, the amount of bulk mail is out of scope. For (E), the price of stamps is out of scope.</p>
