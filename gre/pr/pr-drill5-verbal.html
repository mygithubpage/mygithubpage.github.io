            <p>Rich has a deadline approaching and needs some more time. The storm would have given him a good excuse, but it seems to have changed direction. Its shift, therefore, must have been <em>dis-appointing</em> to him. He planned to use the excuse to buy himself some more time, so <em>garner</em> works in the second blank. The third blank describes the deadline, which is approaching, so <em>nigh</em> works well.</p>

The people who sit <em>for only a few moments</em> are contrasted with the <em>bold</em> who <em>sit for several hours</em>, so you need a word that means <em>not bold</em>. Of the choices, only <em>timorous</em> fits. Now go to the first blank: If some are described as sitting only briefly, and others for longer periods, then something that means <em>period of time</em> would make sense. Of the choices, only <em>duration</em> can mean <em>period of time.</em> The third blank refers to the role the visitors play; since the visitors themselves are half of the performance, you might use a word like <em>necessary</em> to describe what kind of <em>components</em> they are. <em>Integral</em> is another word for necessary, so it’s the best fit.</p>

          <p> Country music scholars generally overlook the role that African-Americans played in the formation of this genre. Typically, scholars trace the birth of country music to the recording sessions that record producer and talent scout Ralph Peer held in Bristol, Tennessee, in 1927. However, the origins of country music go back much further and owe a great deal to African-American musicians, some known and some anonymous and unheralded. The banjo, field hollers, and gospel music are examples of country genre staples that are rooted in the African-American experience. Moreover, some of the “stars” of country music learned their trade from African-American musicians. Rufus “Tee Tot” Payne, for instance, educated Hank Williams. In addition to jazz, gospel, and the blues, country music now clearly needs to be included in the list of musical genres that have an African-American lineage. </p>

          <p> Face perception is the mind’s ability to recognize and register another visage. It plays a significant role in social interactions. Through it we distinguish the familiar from the strange and formulate nuanced readings of people’s moods and characters. However, controversy surrounds the process of face perception. Psychologists argue that it involves a series of stages: Individuals recognize physical features, make broad inferences regarding gender and age, and finally recall meaningful information regarding the face they perceive, such as a name. Cognitive neuroscientists, on the other hand, posit the idea that face perception works through analogy: The mind has an inherent ability to connect similar objects. While the exact process of face perception is still unclear, evidence suggests that it involves a specific set of skills and that the fusiform gyrus, a part of the brain, is necessary for it to occur. </p>

          <p> It has frequently been argued that freeing schools from the rigid rules, regulations, and statutes that have traditionally fettered them would have a revolutionary effect on academic achievement. For instance, it has been suggested that schools embodying this idea could develop more effective teaching methods that could then be replicated in other schools. Charter schools—public schools that operate under a contract, or “charter”—were given just such an opportunity beginning in 1991, when Minnesota passed the first charter school law. At that time, many critics warned of deleterious rather than beneficial effects that such freewheeling schools could have on the academic achievement of students. Thus, while public opinion differed concerning the social desirability of charter schools, most agreed that there would be a pronounced effect. </p>
          <p> Surprisingly, educators who study educational reform now seriously question the degree to which charter schools have made an impact. They conclude that freedom from many of the policies and regulations affecting traditional public schools and the concomitant control over decisions that guide the day-to-day affairs of the school have not resulted in equally dramatic changes in students’ academic performance. In some states, charter schools are less likely to meet state performance standards than traditional public schools. It is, however, impossible to know whether this difference is due to the performance of the schools, the prior achievement of the students, or some other factor. </p>
          <p> Metrics for educational accountability have changed considerably in the past decade, moving increasingly to performance as measured by state mandated tests of individual student achievement. Fundamentally, however, the challenging conditions under which schools operate, be they traditional or charter, have changed little: the struggle for resources, low pay for teachers, accountability to multiple stakeholders, and the difficulty of meeting the educational requirements of children with special needs all persist. </p>

          <p> Many scholars consider Marcel Proust’s <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em> (1913–1927) a significant literary achievement. For instance, Harold Bloom states that it is “widely recognized as the major novel of the twentieth century.” In addition to noting its length—it spans seven volumes and 3,200 pages—many commentaries have focused on Proust’s treatment of two kinds of memory, involuntary and voluntary. Involuntary memory occurs through the stimulation of the senses, while voluntary memory is a deliberate effort to remember the past. For Proust, involuntary memories are superior because they contain the spirit of the past in a way that voluntary memories do not; the former are more vivid, and they have the power to erase the temporal distance between the present moment and past experiences. More recently, scholars such as André Benhaïm have explored the relationship between Proust’s treatment of memory and his representation of France and French culture. According to Benhaïm, memory functions within this text to reconfigure both. </p>
          <p> Proust describes France in ways that one would not expect. In his work, French cities are archaic and exotic. As a result, the narrator becomes a stranger to, or is estranged from, his homeland, and lives the life of an exile. For instance, when recalling his travels through the fictional French town of Balbec, he states, “These strangely ordinary and disdainfully familiar cathedrals cruelly stunned my unconsidered eyes and stabbed my homesick heart.” Words such as “stun” and “stab” suggest the hostility the narrator feels from this French territory. Proust’s suggestion of Middle Eastern influences further distorts the idea of a singular French experience. First, the town’s name refers to the ancient city of Baalbek, located in what is now Lebanon. Second, Balbec is populated by Jewish residents. Proust is widely recognized as an icon of French literature and culture, but ultimately his mysterious representations of this place and its culture call into question the existence of a single Francophone literature or a single French identity. </p>

          <p> According to scholars, the indigenous peoples of ancient Mesoamerica, specifically the Nahuas, developed a rich and complex philosophy comprising four interrelated and overlapping branches of knowledge: metaphysics, epistemology, theory of value, and aesthetics. At the core of their philosophy was <em>teotl</em>, which, rather than an immutable supernatural being like the Judaeo-Christian deity, was an ever-moving and ever-changing, self-producing sacred power that animated the universe and its contents. It was responsible for all things in nature—animals, rocks, rain, and so on—and permeated the details of everything. There was no distinction between teotl and the natural world; teotl was in every entity, and every entity was also teotl. Unlike Western philosophy, which fosters dichotomies such as the personal versus the impersonal, that of the Nahuas posited a sacred power that was united with everything; it was both intrinsic and transcendent. </p>

            <p>To fill in the blank, you need to identify what the professor did to the exam question. Because he or she reordered the sentences and added distractions, he or she made the problem more confusing and unclear. <em>Muddled</em> and <em>obfuscated</em> are synonyms that mean <em>made obscure</em> or <em>unclear</em> and are therefore the correct choices. <em>Erased</em> and <em>obliterated</em> are also synonyms, but do not describe what the professor did to the question. <em>Interpreted</em> means <em>made clear,</em> which is the opposite of what the professor did. <em>Engendered</em> is a nice vocabulary word but means <em>produced</em> or <em>caused,</em> which has nothing to do with making a previously created problem confusing.</p>

            <p>Since the President <em>could not tolerate dissent from his views</em>, you need a word that means his cabinet members would always agree with him. <em>Pundits</em> and <em>authoritarians</em> would offer their own strong opinions, so eliminate choices (A) and (F). <em>Cynics</em> would act <em>pessimistically</em>, so eliminate choice (C). <em>Partisans</em> would be <em>biased</em>, but not necessarily all in the same direction as the President, so eliminate choice (E). <em>Sycophants</em> and <em>toadies</em> in choices (B) and (D) are synonyms indicating that the members are <em>flatterers</em> or <em>yes-men</em>, and produce equivalent statements.</p>

            <p>The clue to the blank is <em>encomium</em>, which means <em>a speech of high praise</em>. Since the poet is young and afraid that her career reached a premature point, the word in the blank must mean peak. <em>Apogee</em> and <em>zenith</em> both mean <em>highest point</em>, so choices (A) and (F) validly complete the sentence. An <em>auspice</em> means <em>good sign</em>, so eliminate choice (B). <em>Coda</em> means a <em>concluding section</em> and does not fit this context, so eliminate choice (C). <em>Nadir</em> and <em>perigee</em> both mean <em>lowest point</em> and are the opposite of what you need, so eliminate choices (D) and (E).</p>

            <p>The logic is hard to follow, so you need a word for the blank that means confusing or convoluted. Both <em>labyrinthine</em> and <em>byzantine</em> mean <em>twisting and turning like a maze,</em> so keep choices (C) and (E). <em>Rhetorical</em> means <em>using a strong, formal writing style,</em> so eliminate choice (A). <em>Libertine</em> and <em>unscrupulous</em> are roughly synonymous, and both mean <em>having lax moral standards,</em> so eliminate choices (B) and (D). <em>Decorous</em> means <em>dignified or proper,</em> so eliminate choice (F).</p>

            <p>The CEO took money, so you need a word for the blank that means the board members, shareholders, and customers punished him. <em>Cachinnated</em> means <em>laughed at,</em> so eliminate choice (A). <em>Blandished</em> means <em>flattered,</em> so eliminate choice (B). <em>Upbraided</em> means <em>censured,</em> and so does <em>lambasted</em>, so keep choices (C) and (F). <em>Simpered</em> means <em>smiled,</em> so eliminate choice (D). <em>Caviled</em> means <em>to find fault with unnecessarily,</em> but since the CEO embezzled, this can’t work.

            <p><strong>      B</strong> and <strong>D</strong></p>
            <p>Since <em>punctilious</em> means <em>having very strong attention to detail, especially with etiquette,</em> this is a good thing to describe <em>service</em>. The word <em>while</em> tells you that you need something in the other direction for cuisine, so you need a word that means the food is not too great. <em>Obsequious</em> means flattering, eliminate choice (A). Both <em>quotidian</em> and <em>pedestrian</em> mean <em>commonplace or boring,</em> so keep choices (B) and (D). <em>Distasteful</em> could work, because it could mean <em>unpleasant tasting,</em> but there is no synonym for this word in the choices, and therefore no way to make the sentence equivalent with another one of the choices. Eliminate choice (C). <em>Gustatory</em> means <em>having to do with the sense of taste.</em> This is too broad, so eliminate choice (E). <em>Pedantic</em> is a synonym for <em>punctilious</em>, but we need the opposite, so eliminate choice (F).</p>

            <p>Recycle the clue <em>angry response</em> into the blank. Three of your choices—<em>laudation</em>, <em>panegyric</em>, and <em>approbation</em>—are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A), (C), and (D). A <em>dictum</em> is a formal or authoritative statement; that’s not supported by the sentence, so eliminate choice (B). Both <em>invective</em> and <em>vituperation</em> can mean <em>a speech of anger,</em> so choices (E) and (F) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>
