          <p> Little is known about the elusive section of the earth’s atmosphere known as the mesosphere. Located between the stratosphere (the maximum altitude that airplanes can achieve) and the thermosphere (the minimum altitude of spacecraft), the mesosphere is poorly understood and little explored. The most significant feature of the mesosphere is the various tides and waves that propagate up from the troposphere and stratosphere. The dissipation of these waves is largely responsible for propelling the mesosphere around the globe. These wave patterns are further affected when gas particles in the mesosphere collide with meteoroids, producing spectacular explosions, which usually generate enough heat to consume the meteor before it can fall to earth. The conflagration leaves behind traces of iron and other metals and fuels the atmospheric tides radiating outward from the mesosphere. </p>

          <p> Television programming is big business, with sales of interstitial advertising reaching billions of dollars annually. Advertising rates are determined by the viewership of the program in question, which has traditionally been determined by ACNielsen, part of The Nielsen Company.

The company has come under criticism for choosing residences that underreport daytime and late-night television viewing and for overrepresenting minorities in sample populations.

 Ischemia is essential to the organ transplantation process.</p>
            <p>
 The same process by which HIT induces hibernation might be applicable to donor organs.</p>
            <p>
 The biggest obstacle facing physicians in the science of organ transplantation is the difficulty of matching suitable donors and recipients.</p>
            <p>
 Additional time could be saved by computerizing the tissue-matching process.</p>
            <p>
 HIT could also be administered to patients awaiting an organ transplant, thereby lengthening the amount of time they are eligible for surgery.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="B">
            <p><strong>B</strong>The woodchuck example is provided to show that the same molecules that induce hibernation might have applications in organs being readied for transplants. Therefore, choice (B) is the best answer. There is no evidence that ischemia plays any role in the transplantation process, so choice (A) is incorrect. Choice (C) is too extreme; nothing is identified as the biggest obstacle. The passage does not comment on the feasibility of changing the tissue-matching process, so choice (D) is not a well-supported answer choice. The passage does not mention the effects of HIT on patients awaiting transplants, so choice (E) is wrong.</p>
          </div>

        <div id="passage3" class="passage">
          <p> Although multi-organ transplants have become more common, scientists and surgeons continue to face the ineluctable obstacle of time. Current donor organ preservation times hover around five to six hours. Because of the complicated tissue-matching process, oftentimes organs are unable to reach their beneficiaries, wasting valuable, viable organs. However, scientists are hopeful that a certain substance, called the Hibernation Induction Trigger (HIT), will extend the life of a potential transplant organ. </p>
          <p> HIT is an opiate-like substance found in the blood of hibernating animals. Previous experiments have shown that opioids act as an autoperfusion block, preventing blood from flowing through the lymphatic system to organs, a phenomenon known as ischemia. In a preliminary experiment, an infusion of plasma with the Delta opioid delayed hemorrhaging in certain laboratory animals. When this arresting of activity was applied to the transplantation of organs, physicians reported preservation times up to 15 hours, a more than two-fold increase over standard conservation. </p>
          <p> Scientists have extrapolated from these findings, further identifying the opioid DADLE as integral to triggering the hibernation process. Infusing HIT-molecule-containing plasma from hibernating woodchucks into canine lungs increased preservation times more than three-fold from previous findings. This experiment suggests that, should a potential donor organ be infused with these trigger molecules before the organ is harvested, the organ would remain transplantable for up to 45 hours, greatly increasing the chance for doctors to find a suitable recipient. </p>
          <p> Though these results are exciting, they do nothing to increase survival rates from an organ transplant operation, which currently hover at 60 percent over four years, because patients are still susceptible to infection and rejection. Scientists are a long way from declaring HIT-molecules a safe and consistent method of organ preservation. Still, other areas of science have taken an interest in this research. NASA, for example, is considering the implications of human hibernation for deep space travel. </p>

            <p>
 DADLE and HIT must be present in an organ at the same time in order for autoperfusion to be prevented for any length of time.</p>
            <p>
 If scientists could circumvent the passage of blood through the lymphatic system, organs would cease to deteriorate.</p>
            <p>
 Scientists are close to developing a method to induce production of HIT in a non-hibernating animal.</p>
            <p>
 Administering HIT after transplantation is likely to lower the current rates of infection and organ rejection.</p>
            <p>
 Isolating and infusing opioids may be the key to retarding the progression of decay in transplant organs.</p>

            <p><strong>E</strong>The passage describes an experiment wherein infusing opioids delayed decay, so choice (E) is true.

            <p><strong>This experiment suggests that, should a potential donor organ be infused with these trigger molecules before the organ is harvested, the organ would remain transplantable for up to 45 hours, greatly increasing the chance for doctors to find a suitable recipient.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The correct sentence indicates that the molecules must be infused <em>before</em> the organ is harvested; this is a limitation. If you chose the sentence in the last paragraph that includes the phrase <em>patients are still susceptible to infection and rejection</em>, you should realize that <em>infection and rejection</em> are not problems related to infusing HIT molecules, but rather of the transplant process itself. Also, the sentence after that one, which begins <em>scientists are still a long way…</em> mentions the limitation of safety and consistency, problems which the question specifically indicates are not what you should be looking for in the correct answer.</p>
