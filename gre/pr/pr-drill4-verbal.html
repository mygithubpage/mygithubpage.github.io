          <p> Some readers categorize Maxine Hong Kingston as a great Asian-American writer, a classification that is ultimately too narrow for her body of work. However, the subject matter of Kingston’s novels and autobiographies espouses the Asian immigrant experience, as the following characters suggest: immigrant laborers in California and Hawaii, railroad laborers, and Chinese doctors. In natural harmony with her choice of subject matter are the personal sensibilities of a first-generation American writer who endeavors to explain her mother’s alien sensibility and her relationship with her silent, angry father. </p>
          <p> Kingston’s Asian influences are present in another type of work, Chinese myths in the guise of “talk stories.” A character in her novel Tripmaster Monkey is based on Sun Wu Kong, a mythical Chinese figure. In response to this work, Herbert Gold notes that the author “invigorates her novel with an avid personal perspective, doing what the novel is supposed to do—she brings us the news of the world and makes magic of it.” </p>

          <p><em>Préciosité</em>, “preciousness,” or the manifestation of the baroque in literature, is often dismissed as a “feminine concoction,” mocked by Molière and thought to be ridiculous by modern standards. Preferring appearance to substance and excess to moderation, baroque expression is given to wild exaggeration and purple description. However, when one considers its historical context, the movement can be seen as a subtle rebellion by an otherwise powerless sex against its restrictive society. </p>
          <p> Crippled and stunned from a series of religious wars, seventeenth-century France under Louis XIII was characterized by political intrigue and violence. Escaping the crude court, a group of cultured and educated ladies met to discuss—in a fantastically embellished and witty manner—literature, art, and philosophy. They rejected the predominant emphasis on vulgarity and sought the elevation of <em>l’éducation</em>, or “manners” they considered essential to society. More salons followed, and these <em>précieuses</em> (literally, “precious ones”) produced works of literature that are still widely read, such as novels, essays, and poems that elevated the ideal of courtly, or Platonic, love with an emphasis on sensuality and scrupulous rules of behavior. </p>
          <p> Though men scoffed at their wives’ pretensions, baroque literature as a reaction to political instability reawakened French proclivities for cultural expression. When Louis XIV ascended to the throne in 1661, French society was primed for the reestablishment of the arts. Baroque ideals served important roles regarding the criticism of the political situation and the influence of cultural trends. Louis XIV’s peace provoked the cultural pendulum to swing to the other direction, ushering in a neo-classical movement that elevated simplicity and minimalism. It is surely no coincidence that it was the performance of “Les Précieuses Ridicules” (“The Conceited Ladies”), Moliere’s play mocking <em>préciosité</em>, that first gained him wide acclaim and established him as the preeminent father of French theater. </p>

          <p> The mid-nineteenth century witnessed two major wars on U.S. soil: the Mexican-American War and the Civil War. That Abraham Lincoln would commit the country to civil war appears to require little explanation, since he endorsed the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the young nation. However, Lincoln’s disdain for the Mexican-American War, which was ostensibly fought to keep Texas in the Union, requires some examination. After all, Lincoln’s swift military response to the Southern secessionists at the beginning of the Civil War illustrates that Lincoln would not shrink from battle if the war could ensure a united country. Perhaps Lincoln’s resistance to the Mexican-American War can best be seen in light of his sincere belief that President Polk had overstepped his constitutional boundaries in declaring war against Mexico, a sovereign nation. In this light, it is perhaps ironic that Lincoln’s own presidential legacy includes a greater centralization of federal government power. </p>

          <p> The increasing pressure on American businesses to pursue cost-cutting measures will eventually lead to an increase in the outsourcing of business processes to venues with lower overhead, such as India. However, this shift may not provide the dramatic gains for American business that might have been expected by an enterprise with an ethos for change that is oriented to preserving bottom-line profits. The difficulty is that a significant portion of American society remains uncomfortable with shifting business tasks overseas. Therefore, American businesses will predominantly opt for outsourcing opportunities for repetitive tasks that can easily be brought back to the United States if necessary. Nevertheless, opportunities for Indian firms to get a larger piece of the pie seem certain to arise. The growing emphasis on bringing down the cost of back-office operations is bound to offer increasing scope for Indian firms to become involved in novel types of ever more complex business processes. </p>

          <p> Scientists are growing increasingly concerned that coral, which grows abundantly in the circumtropical shallow waters near bodies of land, is evincing a paling, or bleaching effect. Though experts are still at odds over what has precipitated this event, most agree that it is a stress response to changes in habitat and water quality, including temperature variations and salination percentage, and predict a loss of 95 percent of existing coral populations. </p>
          <p> An exemplary symbiotic entity, scleractinian coral lives harmoniously with vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. Corals receive nutrients in two ways: by capturing planktonic organisms with nematocyst-capped tentacles and by resource-sharing and recycling with single-celled algae called zooxanthellae. These algae live within the polyps of the coral, using photosynthesis to increase (and thereby strengthen) coral calcification, and providing energy for coral growth. The zooxanthellae benefit from the relationship through protection from predators and a steady supply of necessary carbon dioxide. Interestingly, it is the zooxanthellae that provide coral with its brilliant coloration. </p>
          <p> When coral loses its color, it is a sign that the single-celled algae are not able to thrive. Though not necessarily a sign of mortality, a pale, wan color indicates imminent danger and is considered a stress response. The zooxanthellate invertebrates lose their concentration of pigmentation or die altogether when stressed, turning translucent and allowing the slightly darker coral skeleton to show through the decaying tissue. Whether this response stems from anthropogenic pollutions such as overharvesting coral for the exotic travel market, overfishing coral waters, and increased water temperatures due to global warming, or from natural disturbances (storms, temperature extremes, and diseases), scientists fear for the future of the radiant corals. If zooxanthellate populations continue to decrease without recovery, their host corals will eventually follow suit, triggering a cascade of unanticipated biological events. </p>

            <p>To prepare for his speech, Thomas was <em>dutifully rehearsing</em>, your clue that the speech was well spoken. Synonyms for <em>well-spoken</em> are <em>eloquent</em> and <em>articulate</em>, which are your answers. <em>Languid</em> means <em>dull</em> and <em>listless</em> means <em>without energy;</em> both are similar adjectives that Thomas would try to avoid. <em>Extended</em> means <em>long,</em> and you have no clues that the speech should be long. Finally, <em>enduring</em> means <em>everlasting</em> and, while such a speech would be commendable, Thomas is more interested in the well-spoken aspect of his speech.</p>

            <p>The time trigger <em>only later</em> tells you that the earlier feudal system differed from the <em>fully-developed</em> version that came later, so the word for the blank needs to mean <em>not fully developed</em>. Both <em>byzantine</em> and <em>labyrinthine</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (B) and (D). Neither <em>refractory</em>, which means <em>stubborn,</em> nor <em>perfidious</em>, which means <em>disloyal,</em> is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (A) and (F). Both <em>nascent</em> and <em>inchoate</em> can mean <em>not fully formed,</em> so choices (C) and (E) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>The blank describes the kind of <em>lyrics</em> that would create a <em>tension</em> with <em>cheerful, almost bouncy music</em>, so a word that means something like <em>sad</em> would make sense. Both <em>euphoric</em> and <em>sanguine</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (B) and (C). Neither <em>lubricious</em>, which means <em>lewd,</em> nor <em>recondite</em>, which means <em>not widely known,</em> is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (A) and (E). Both <em>saturnine</em> and <em>lachrymose</em> mean <em>sad,</em> so choices (D) and (F) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>Recycle the clue <em>delicate</em> into the blank. Both <em>ponderous</em> and <em>cumbersome</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (C) and (E). Neither <em>ephemeral</em>, which means <em>short-lived,</em> nor <em>mettlesome</em>, which means <em>courageous,</em> is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (A) and (D). Both <em>diaphanous</em> and <em>gossamer</em> can mean <em>delicate,</em> so choices (B) and (F) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences. If you selected choice (A), be sure to distinguish <em>ephemeral</em> from <em>ethereal</em>, which would have been an appropriate answer choice.</p>

            <p>Since the <em>fascination with celebrities</em> and the <em>innovations of the electronic age may inspire</em> something to occur, you need a word that means <em>about to happen</em>. <em>Flagging</em> and <em>attenuating</em> mean <em>weakening</em>, so those words go in the opposite direction from the blank. <em>Calumniating</em> means <em>slandering</em>; while the new paparazzi may indeed be engaging in slander, that’s not what the blank is talking about. <em>Deliquescing</em> means <em>becoming liquid</em>, and a trend can’t do that. <em>Looming</em> and <em>impending</em> both mean <em>about to happen</em>, so those words are good fits for the blank.</p>

            <p>The blank must describe the doctor’s friends, so look for the clue that gives information about those friends. The friends <em>quickly jilted him</em>, meaning that they dishonorably abandoned him. Friends who would do that are not very good friends, so you’re looking for a word that means <em>not loyal</em>. <em>Squeamish</em> describes someone who becomes uncomfortable easily, usually around things that are unpleasant to the senses (blood, rodents, etc.). While the friends may be <em>uncomfortable</em> in the doctor’s presence, that’s not why they abandoned him. <em>Orthodox</em> and <em>stodgy</em> describe people who adhere rigidly to convention. These words describe the <em>medical establishment</em>, not the friends. A <em>staunch</em> ally is one who is loyal, so that word means the opposite of the blank. <em>Fickle</em> and <em>inconstant</em> both mean <em>disloyal</em>, and so they are good fits for the blank.</p>
