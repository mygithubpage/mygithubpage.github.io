            <p>The blank is about <em>vampire novels [now] on the market,</em> so look for a clue that describes the current status of those books. Although such novels <em>once evoked excitement,</em> that response <em>has been deadened by [the books’] sheer numbers,</em> so there must now be a lot of them on today’s market. Write down “a lot” and cross off answers that don’t match. The clue in this sentence is <em>sheer number</em>. Both <em>glut</em> and <em>inundation</em> match the predicted answer, and are thus the credited responses.

Write down something like “false” for the blank. <em>Specious</em> and <em>spurious</em> both mean <em>false</em>, so (B) and (E) are correct.

            <p><em>Even though</em> is a transition that changes direction, so the paintings must have been hung in a way contrary to what one would expect from the clue. Since the curator <em>spent several months arranging the exhibit,</em> one might expect the paintings to appear <em>as if they had been hung with</em> great care over a long period; write down the opposite, such as “sloppiness and speed.” Now look to eliminate words that don’t match<em>.

Write down “complete” and look to eliminate words that don’t match. <em>Comprehensive</em> and <em>exhaustive</em> both mean “complete,” so choices (C) and (F) are the correct answers.

            <p>The transition <em>while</em> and the juxtaposition of <em>showing leniency</em> and <em>punishing ruthlessly</em> indicate that <em>leniency</em> (mercy) was shown to those who did the opposite of <em>remain defiant</em>, so write down “not defiant” for the blank, and cross off answer choices that don’t match. Both <em>complaisant</em> and <em>obeisant</em> mean submissive (i.e. “not defiant”), so answer choices (B) and (C) are correct.

Look to eliminate words that don’t match “reject” or “give up.” Both <em>legitimize</em> and <em>espouse</em> mean the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate (D) and (E). Neither <em>desiccate</em>, which means to dry out, nor <em>exacerbate</em>, which means to make worse, means “reject” or “give up,” so eliminate choices (A) and (C).

Even if you don’t know the word <em>tonic</em>, the fact that <em>amateurish</em> is the opposite of <em>slick</em> indicates that the word in the blank must mean the opposite of <em>homogeneity</em>; write down “non-sameness” and eliminate answers that don’t match. Both <em>eccentricities</em> and <em>idiosyncrasies</em> describe peculiar qualities or quirks, which match the predicted answer; the correct answers are thus (B) and (F).</p>

            <p>The sentence begins with the transition word <em>though</em> and the time transition <em>previous</em>, indicating a shift in meaning within the sentence. In the first part, the futurist <em>conceded that Apple’s iPhone was a revolutionary device,</em> so the second part must refer to a contrasting idea, such as “old-fashioned.” Be aware of the phrase <em>it would not be immune</em>, which creates a sort of double negative that cancels itself out and keeps the blank going in the opposite direction of the clues. Additional support for a contrasting word in the blank comes from the mention of <em>products</em> like <em>Ford’s Model T</em> and <em>Sony’s Walkman</em>; if they were only <em>previous[ly] “game changing,”</em> they must now be <em>considered</em> “old-fashioned.” Eliminate <em>avant</em>-<em>garde</em> and <em>radical</em>, which reflect the clues (<em>revolutionary</em> and <em>“game changing”</em>) without the contrast required by the transitions (<em>though</em> and <em>previous</em>). <em>Electronic</em> and <em>circuitous</em> are trap answers, as they sound related to devices like the iPhone (which have electronic circuits), but don’t match “old-fashioned.” Only <em>antediluvian</em> and <em>superannuated</em> match the predicted answer, so (D) and (E) are the credited responses.</p>

Write down “unsellable/out of style” for the blank. <em>Chic</em> is a trap answer, as it means “stylish” (the opposite of one half of the predicted answer). <em>Inapplicable</em> doesn’t match either half of the predicted answer. <em>Repulsive</em> or <em>disagreeable</em> shoes would probably be hard to sell, but those words have nothing to do with changing styles.

            <p>Though Salsa takes its roots from various countries in Central and South America, it is fundamentally and essentially Cuban: its development was a _______, but ultimately the music belongs to one country.</p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong></p>
            <p>Keep track of the transitions in this sentence. The <em>but</em> means that the <em>development [of Salsa]</em> had a characteristic inconsistent with <em>belongs to one country</em>, so the blank means something like “belongs to more than one country.” This predicted answer is echoed by the first half of the sentence, with the transition <em>[t]hough</em> changing the direction from the clue that <em>Salsa takes its roots from various countries</em>; the second half of the sentence parallels the contrast (from multiple sources to a single source) in the first half. <em>Feat</em> and <em>coup</em> are synonyms meaning “achievement,” which doesn’t match “belonging to more than one country.” <em>Lyric</em> is a distractor that looks attractive because of its association with music, but also strays far from the predicted answer. <em>Denouement</em> (final outcome) can also be eliminated. That leaves <em>collaboration</em> and <em>synergism</em>, which both describe teamwork among various actors; the correct answers are thus (A) and (B).</p>

            <p>The praise the students received for their flashy presentation and detailed handouts was utterly unwarranted, for their apparent diligence was motivated merely by _______.</p>

            <p><strong>D</strong> and <strong>F</strong></p>
            <p>If the students’ diligence was only <em>apparent</em> and the praise they received was <em>unwarranted</em>, then their motivation must have been <em>merely</em> to receive <em>the praise</em> they did not deserve. Write down “desire for praise” and cross off words that don’t match. <em>Assiduity</em> is a near synonym for <em>diligence</em>, so that word is the opposite of what should go in the blank. Eliminate <em>prepossession</em> (favorable bias), <em>cronyism</em> (giving preference to friends in hiring or appointment decisions), and <em>torpidity</em> (sluggishness). <em>Sycophancy</em> and <em>obsequiousness</em> both describe insincere behaviors designed to gain favor with superiors, so (D) and (F) are the credited responses.</p>
