        <p>Called by some the “island that time forgot,” Madagascar is home to a vast array of unique, exotic creatures. One such animal is the aye-aye. First described by western science in 1782, it was initially categorized as a member of the order Rodentia. Further research then revealed that it was more closely related to the lemur, a member of the primate order. Since the aye-aye is so different from its fellow primates, however, it was given its own family: <em>Daubentoniidae</em>. The aye-aye has been listed as an endangered species and, as a result, the government of Madagascar has designated an island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar as a protected reserve for aye-ayes and other wildlife.</p>
        <p>Long before Western science became enthralled with this nocturnal denizen of Madagascar’s jungles, the aye-aye had its own reputation with the local people. The aye-aye is perhaps best known for its large, round eyes and long, extremely thin middle finger. These adaptations are quite sensible, allowing the aye-aye to see well at night and retrieve grubs, which are one of its primary food sources, from deep within hollow branches. However, the aye-aye’s striking appearance may end up causing its extinction. The people of Madagascar believe that the aye-aye is a type of spirit animal, and that its appearance is an omen of death. Whenever one is sighted, it is immediately killed. When combined with the loss of large swaths of jungle habitat, this practice may result in the loss of <span data-question="2">a superb example of life’s variety.</span></p>

        <p>A novel that is a bestseller is often, because of its popularity, not taken seriously as literature. <span data-question="5">Critics seem to presuppose that great literature must be somehow burdensome to the reader; it must be difficult for the uninitiated to understand.</span> It is precisely this inverted snobbery that has hindered Isabel Allende’s <em>The</em><em>House of the Spirits</em> from gaining the critical attention it deserves.</p>
        <p>Published in 1982, the novel draws deeply on the author’s own family history. Allende is the first cousin once removed of former Chilean president Salvador Allende, who was murdered during a right-wing military coup in 1973. Yet rather than the to-be-expected socialist harangue, Allende subtly works her political message within the fabric of the compelling narrative she weaves. While Allende borrows a bit too freely from Gabriel García Márquez’s work, she nevertheless has a powerful and original voice within the construct of magical realism.</p>

The passage states, “rather than the to-be-expected socialist harangue, Allende subtly works her political message within the fabric of the compelling narrative she weaves.” In other words, a reader might have expected Allende to include strong socialist propaganda within her novel, but she did not. Choice (A) is incorrect. Although the passage talks about Allende's background, it is not clear that her novel is autobiographical in nature. Choice (B) is incorrect because although the passage states that Allende's work would have received more critical attention if the book had been thought of as great literature, it is not clear that it would have received more favorable reviews.

The second blank comes after a couple of transition words. The first is <em>Of course</em>, which might sound like the passage is continuing in the same direction, but here indicates a change of direction: The author is conceding that sometimes incumbents face challenges.

That is what <em>merely denouement</em> means. <em>Seldom nugatory</em> means rarely inconsequential, which is the opposite of what the passage calls for; <em>remarkably</em><em>contentious</em> is wrong for the same reason, as that phrase would indicate that the general election is fiercely contested.</p>

For the first blank, Molly <em>could comprehend</em> Spanish before their trip, so she was <em>becoming familiar</em> with Spanish. Only <em>practicing</em> fits. <em>Mastering</em> goes too far. Now you can turn your attention to the third blank. Because she is learning Spanish, it must be a <em>new</em> language for her, and only <em>unfamiliar</em> fits for the third blank.

            <p><b>10. B demarcates, D apocryphal, and I senescence</b>. The first blank refers to what some people believe about the human lifespan representing the <em>outer bounds of animal longevity</em> in relation to that of other animals. So, look for a word that means <em>marker</em>. <em>Demarcates</em> is the best fit, as <em>belies</em> means contradicts, and <em>antedates</em> means comes before. The second blank refers to the stories of musket balls being found in turtle shells and how some people <em>tend to dismiss tales</em> about turtles living a long time, so a word such as <em>questionable</em> would fit. <em>Apocryphal</em> means questionable, making it the best choice. The clue for the final blank is that some turtles <em>show(ing) no signs of aging even as they pass the two-century mark</em> so look for a word that works with <em>negligible</em> to create a phrase that means “not growing old.” <em>Senescence</em> means growing old and when combined with negligible, is a good fit for this clue.</p>

            <p><b>3. D diminishes and F wanes</b>. The clue “due to the increased aerodynamic drag” suggests that fuel efficiency is likely to decrease as speed increases. <em>Diminishes</em> and <em>wanes</em> both mean decreases. Eliminate <em>equalizes</em> and <em>stabilizes</em> because they mean the fuel efficiency evens out. <em>Adapts</em> and <em>increases</em> do not fit the clue, and neither has a synonym among the other answer choices.</p>

            <p><b>4. B an inept and F a maladroit</b>. <em>Despite</em> acts as a change-of-direction transition that, combined with “vast amount of time Francis dedicated to learning six different languages,” tells you that something is wrong with Francis's communication skills. The last part of the sentence provides an additional clue: “failed to redress his inability to construct cogent prose” means that he doesn't make sense. The blank must mean <em>ineffective</em>, so <em>inept</em> and <em>maladroit</em> are the correct answers. Nothing tells us how Francis feels, so <em>morose</em> won't work. <em>Astute</em> is the opposite of what's needed. Though it's possible Francis is <em>florid</em> and <em>prolific</em>, the clues don't directly support these ideas.</p>

            <p><b>5. E temperament and F humor</b>. The main clues are that one twin is described as <em>sanguine</em>, the other <em>choleric</em>; even if you don't know these words, the phrases “even in times of stress” and “angry outbursts” suggest that they are words used to describe <em>personality</em>. <em>Temperament</em> is a good synonym for <em>personality</em>. While it is frequently used to mean comedy, <em>humor</em> can also mean personality, especially in conjunction with words such as <em>sanguine</em> and <em>choleric</em>, which derive from the ancient belief that temperament was shaped by the levels of different fluids, or humors, in a person's body. The remaining choices don't fit: <em>Environment</em> means one's surroundings, while the other three words are concerned with the physical rather than the mental.</p>
