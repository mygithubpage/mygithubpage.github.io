      <h4>Question</h4>
      <p>The director of the International Health Foundation recently released this announcement:</p>
      <p>“A new medical test that allows the early detection of a particular disease will prevent the deaths of people all over the world who would otherwise die from the disease. The test has been extremely effective in allowing doctors to diagnose the disease six months to a year before it would have been spotted by conventional means. As soon as we can institute this test as routine procedure in hospitals around the world, the death rate from this disease will plummet.”</p>

      <h4>Strategies</h4>

      <h5>Doing the Actual Analysis of the Argument</h5>
      <p>The conclusion in this argument comes in the first line:</p>
      <p><em>A new medical test that allows the early detection of a particular disease will prevent the deaths of people all over the world who would otherwise die from that disease.</em></p>
      <p>The premises are the evidence in support of this conclusion.</p>
      <p><em>The test has been extremely effective in allowing doctors to diagnose the disease six months to a year before it would have been spotted by conventional means.</em></p>

      <h5>Brainstorming for Assumptions</h5>
      <p>You can often find assumptions by looking for a gap in the reasoning. <em>Early detection allows patients to survive</em>: In turn, the early detection of the disease allows patients to survive the disease. Well, hold on a minute. Is this necessarily true?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, do we know that early detection will <em>necessarily</em> lead to survival? We don’t even know if this disease is curable. Early detection of an incurable disease is not going to help anyone survive it.</li>
        <li>Second, will the test be widely available and cheap enough for general use? If the test is expensive or available only in certain parts of the world, people will continue to die from the disease.</li>
        <li>Third, will doctors and patients interpret the tests correctly? The test may be fine, but if doctors misinterpret the results or if patients ignore the need for treatment, then the test will not save lives.</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Organizing the Analysis of an Argument Essay</h5>
      <p>You’re simply going to reiterate the argument, attack the argument in three different ways (each in a separate paragraph), summarize what you’ve said, and mention how the argument could be strengthened. From an organizational standpoint, this is pretty easy. Try to minimize your use of the word <em>I</em>. Your opinion is not the point in an Analysis of an Argument essay. here’s one possible structure:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The argument that (restatement of the conclusion) is not entirely logically convincing, since it ignores certain crucial assumptions.</li>
        <li>First, the argument assumes that:</li>
        <li>Second, the argument never addresses:</li>
        <li>Finally, the argument omits:</li>
        <li>Thus, the argument is not completely sound. The evidence in support of the conclusion is not sufficient to support the conclusion of the argument because:</li>
        <li>Ultimately, the argument might have been strengthened by:</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Sample Response</h4>
      <p>The argument that the new medical test will prevent deaths that would have occurred in the past is not entirely logically convincing since it ignores certain crucial assumptions.</p>
      <p>First, the argument assumes that early detection of the disease will lead to an immediate drop in the mortality rate from this disease, yet it does nothing to explain how this will happen, and so on.</p>
      <p>Second, the argument never addresses the point that the existence of this new test, even if totally effective, is not the same as the widespread use of the test, and so on.</p>
      <p>Finally, even supposing the ability of early detection to save lives and the widespread use of the test, the argument still depends on the doctors’ correct interpretation of the test and the patients’ willingness to undergo treatment, and so on.</p>
      <p>Thus, the argument is not completely sound. The evidence in support of the conclusion that the test will cause death rates to plummet does little to prove that conclusion, since it does not address the assumptions already raised. Ultimately, the argument might have been strengthened if the author could have shown that the disease responds to early treatment, which can be enacted immediately upon receipt of the test results, that the test will be widely available around the world, and that doctors and patients will make proper use of the test.</p>
