An <em>exegesis</em> is a <em>critical explanation</em>, or <em>scholarly study</em>, and is correct.

            <p><strong>By 1926, speculating on pricing was a crime.</strong> The question asks for a description of <em>an action undertaken by the Soviet government.</em> Most of the third paragraph details the actions of the NEPmen. Line 27, <em>The state could not produce consumer goods…</em> is incorrect because it does not describe an actual action by the Soviet government, but describes an action the government could not do: producing enough goods. Line 35, <em>Since the state could not produce or profit…</em> is incorrect because, although it says that the state <em>adopted measures,</em> it does not specify what those measure were. <em>By 1926, speculating on pricing was a crime</em> is the answer because it specifies the action the Soviet government took against the NEPmen: It made speculation a crime.</p>

        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p> The harshness and extreme unpopularity of the “war communism” system imposed in Russia from 1918 to 1921 led the Soviet leadership to adopt the New Economic Policy (NEP) in March of 1921. Under the NEP, the prodnalog system of tax in kind was begun, and a semi-market economy was allowed to develop alongside government control of what Lenin had called the “commanding heights industries.” When the NEP was abandoned in 1927, the state declared it a failure as a result of several adverse events: the scissors crisis, the goods famine, and speculation by “NEPmen.” </p>
          <p> The scissors crisis of 1923 was caused by high industrial prices relative to agricultural prices. When these two sets of prices are graphed, the wide disparity resembles an open pair of scissors. The government had been spurring industry but felt that this price disparity had to be immediately addressed. To do so, it adopted policies favoring agriculture. There is some speculation by economists, however, that the scissors would have closed on their own. </p>
          <p> The goods famine occurred at roughly the same time. Because of burgeoning industry, demand for industrial and consumer products skyrocketed. The state could not produce goods equal to demand, forcing prices up. In the midst of shortages, the state found itself in a losing contest with “NEPmen,” small entrepreneurs who sold goods at prices often higher than those of the state. NEPmen were seen as capitalists who sought to return the Soviet state to its position as lapdog to the Western capitalist states. Since the state could not produce or profit as well as the NEPmen, it adopted measures to put the NEPmen out of business. By 1926, speculating on pricing was a crime. As a result, profits and incentives had fallen, and the speculation crisis was somewhat alleviated. </p>

 B</strong>According to the passage, <em>the burning of fossil fuels, which have no carbon-14 content, has diluted the atmospheric carbon-14 content</em> Since carbon dating works by comparing the percentage of carbon remaining in an ancient object to that found in living matter, you would need to have a consistent ratio of carbon-14. Because the burning of fossil fuels has decreased that ratio, however, living matter that died prior to the burning of fossil fuels would have more carbon-14 content when it died, and would therefore appear to have died more recently.

          <p> The determination of the age of KNM-ER 1470, a humanoid skull, would add greatly to our knowledge of mammalian evolution. Anthropologists originally dated the <em>habilis</em> skull at 3 million years old. This age seemed unlikely because it was older than the age of any known australophithecines, which are presumed to be the <em>habilis</em>’s ancestor. Further attempts to date the skull have led to speculative results. </p>
          <p> An elemental property of all living things is that they contain a certain portion of their carbon as the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Carbon-14 is created when solar radiation blasts nuclei in the upper atmosphere, in turn producing neutrons that bombard nitrogen-14 at lower altitudes, turning it into carbon-14. All living things maintain an equilibrium of carbon-14 as they exchange carbon with their surrounding atmosphere. Presuming the rate of production to be constant, the activity of a sample can be compared to the equilibrium activity of living matter, and thus the age can be calculated. However, carbon-14 decays at a half-life of 5730 years, limiting age determinations to the order of 50,000 years. This time frame can be extended to perhaps 100,000 years using accelerator techniques. Even so, at these ages carbon dating is increasingly unreliable as a result of changes in the carbon-isotope mix. Over the last century, the burning of fossil fuels, which have no carbon-14 content, have had a diluting effect on the atmospheric carbon-14. As a countervailing effect, atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950s may well have doubled the atmosphere’s carbon-14 content. </p>
          <p> Other radiometric dating methods, using relative concentrations of parent-daughter products in radio decay changes of other elements, such as argon, may prove to be of greater benefit for dating such ancient samples as <em>habilis</em>. However, the assumption that the decay rates of these isotopes have always been constant would first have to be substantiated. </p>

 A</strong>In the first paragraph, the author discusses the trouble that anthropologists have had in dating the <em>habilis</em> skull, which at first they thought to be 3 million years old. In the second paragraph, the author describes how carbon dating techniques work; objects are dated by the ratio of carbon-14 they possess. However, the author goes on to show that the half-life of carbon can date objects only up to 50,000 years old, or 100,000 years at most if accelerator techniques are used. This limitation suggests that carbon dating is unsuitable for providing the exact age of the <em>habilis</em> skull, making choice (A) the best answer. Choice (B) is actually the opposite of what the author suggests for the time frame being discussed. Choice (C) does not answer the question; while the difference is indeed highlighted, this answer ignores the <em>purpose</em> of the contrast. In choice (D), accelerator techniques would still not be adequate to date <em>habilis.</em> Choice (E) is off the mark; the half-life in itself does not <em>illustrate the equilibrium.</em></p>

 Alternatives to fossil fuels should be pursued to prevent further interference with carbon dating procedures.</p>

 Decay rates of isotopes involved in radiometric methods need to be invariable.</p>

 Carbon-14 levels could be artificially restored to previous historical levels to allow an appropriate basis of comparison.</p>

            <p><strong>
 C</strong>The proposed solution comes at the end of the passage, where the author discusses radiometric dating methods, so the answer needs to address the requirements of this solution. There is an assumption in this method that the isotopes being measured decay at a consistent rate, and this issue is best addressed in choice (C). While choice (E) addresses radiometric methods, the author does not discuss the equipment involved in the process. The remaining answers do not cover this proposed solution.</p>
