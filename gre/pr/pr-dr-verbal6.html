As always, pay attention to trigger words. The second sentence says, <em>while</em>, which signals that blank (ii) must be different from <em>remains the subject of polarizing debates</em> This is a change in direction, so one would think there would only be one view. So the second blank should say something like <em>past</em> or <em>over</em><em>Free from</em> works the best. Since everything is being argued, we need something negative or argumentative for the last blank. That knocks out <em>mellifluous</em> and <em>objective.</em> The first blank speculates on whether or not historical arguments are ever over. <em>Apolitical</em> is the best stand-in for the end of arguments over history.</p>

          <p> William Le Baron Jenney is considered the founder of the Chicago School of architecture, as well as the father of the American skyscraper. He served as an engineering officer during the Civil War but by 1868 was a practicing architect. His greatest accomplishments were his mammoth commercial buildings, including the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, which was one of the first buildings to use a metal skeleton. This structure, in fact, would become the archetypical American skyscraper design. Other notable accomplishments included his 16-story Manhattan Building, which was the first edifice ever to achieve that height, and the Horticultural Building, which was the largest botanical conservatory ever erected. </p>
          <p> William Holabird also assisted in the evolution of the Chicago School, beginning as a draftsman for Jenney and then founding his own practice in 1880. Holabird invented the “Chicago window,” which made buildings appear to be constructed of glass. </p>

 Though the Earth’s magnetic field largely protects it from the full effects of solar winds, the winds have an impact on its magnetosphere and its space environment.</p>

 Solar winds play a significant role in the development of auroras and geomagnetic storms in the earth’s space environment.</p>
            <p>
 Because of the corona’s intense heat, solar wind particles continuously escape the sun’s gravitational attraction, flowing away from the corona at extremely high velocities and surrounding the Earth with hot, super-charged plasma.</p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong></p>
            <p>Since s<em>olar winds are directly related to geomagnetic storms, auroras, and comets</em>, and cause comet tails to bend in particular directions, they <em>play a significant role in the development of auroras and geomagnetic storms</em>, thus supporting choice (B). The second paragraph states both that the Earth’s magnetic field protects it from the solar winds, and that <em>solar winds are responsible for the Earth’s magnetosphere, and changes in their speed and direction strongly influence Earth’s space environment</em>, thus supporting choice (A). The first part of choice (C) is almost an exact reproduction of sentence 3, but that sentence doesn’t say anything about <em>super-charged plasma</em></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="passage2" class="passage">
          <p> “Solar wind” is the term scientists use to describe the stream of particles that the sun’s corona constantly emits. These solar winds, which consist mainly of hydrogen and helium, are intensely hot, fully ionized plasma. Because of the corona’s intense heat, these particles continuously escape the sun’s gravitational attraction, flowing away from the sun at extreme velocities. Solar winds, though, are not without variation, because they contain faster and slower moving pockets. For instance, solar winds that originate from streamers are slower moving winds at approximately 300 km/second, as opposed to the winds that originate from corona holes and reach speeds of 800 km/second. As they flow away from the sun, tangential discontinuities and interplanetary shocks form, producing pressure variations. Moreover, researchers also know that solar winds are directly related to geomagnetic storms, auroras, and comets. It is these winds that cause comet tails to bend away from the sun, as Kepler accurately predicted in the early 1600s. </p>
          <p> Studies have been done on the effect of solar winds on the planets in the solar system. While all the planets are surrounded by this hot, super-charged plasma, the Earth’s magnetic field protects it from the solar wind by deflecting the particles. However, solar winds are responsible for the Earth’s magnetosphere, and changes in their speed and direction strongly influence Earth’s space environment. As the planet closest to the sun, Mercury endures the main impact of solar winds. If Mercury had an atmosphere, these winds would have stripped it away, leaving the planet bathed in radiation. Though Mars is much further from the sun than Mercury, solar winds have also greatly reduced its atmosphere. While Venus has a substantial atmosphere—100 times denser than ours—solar winds reduce its clouds. It is not just those planets nearest the sun which bear the effects of solar winds: The winds travel far beyond the limits of Pluto. Interestingly, while much is now known about solar winds, scientists still do not fully understand how the gases and particles in the sun’s corona reach such high velocities. </p>

          <p> Pickett does present a wealth of examples, along with a refreshingly candid argument that America often goes to war for an abstract ideal such as democratization of societies, world peace, liberty, or freedom. For instance, the Spanish-American War of 1898 was ostensibly a consequence of national enthusiasm for the cause of Cuban liberty. And, more obviously, America’s entry into World War I stemmed from a desire to “make the world safe for democracy.” Although these observations are supportable, Pickett overstates the case when he argues that these abstract causes typically lead to a war hysteria in which American leadership can no longer enforce any measured policies. </p>

 The rationale for American warfare is well documented.</p>
            <p>
 Pickett provides a cogent rationale for why America engages in warfare; however, he draws conclusions that the author does not fully support.</p>
            <p>
 Pickett’s analysis of American military history provides the definitive historical record of the period from the Spanish-American War to World War I.</p>

            <p><strong>
 D</strong>The topic of the passage is Pickett’s interpretation of American military history. In the second paragraph, the author states that while Pickett’s work provides a <em>refreshingly candid argument</em> of why America goes to war, he <em>overstates the case when he argues that these abstract causes typically lead to a war hysteria in which American leadership can no longer enforce any measured policies</em> In other words, while the author believes that some of the ideas Pickett presents are correct, the author also notes that Pickett’s conclusions cannot be fully supported. The best answer is therefore choice (D). All the other answers are outside the scope of the passage. Additionally, choices (B) and (E) are extreme.</p>

The <em>while</em> trigger changes the direction of the second part of the sentence, which you can see with the mention of the <em>harmless scarlet kingsnake</em>, but then there’s another contrast with the <em>simply mimic</em> phrase. This brings you back to the animals that are <em>unpalatable or dangerous</em> You can recycle <em>dangerous</em> for the blank. Eliminate choice (B) right away, because if the animals are dangerous, they definitely aren’t friendly. Choice (D) might initially look appealing, but it actually means <em>beautiful</em> While the animals might be brightly colored, you’re looking for something that means <em>dangerous</em>, so you can eliminate that answer. You’re left with two sets of synonyms, choices (A) and (E) and choices (C) and (F). The words in the second set, choices (C) and (F), mean <em>edible</em> If you missed one of the contrast triggers, you might be tempted to go with that pair, but because you have the two different changes of direction, you can eliminate them.
