          <div class="question">
            <p>Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="choices">
            <p>Scientists have proven the big bang theory to be inaccurate and replaced it with the concept that the universe inflated over time.</p>
            <p>Because the big bang theory cannot account for the actual state of the universe, it is possible that the universe actually evolved through inflation.</p>
            <p>The big bang theory cannot be discounted completely, but the inflationary theory is also plagued by inconsistencies.</p>
            <p>The big bang theory is incorrect because of the absence of magnetic monopoles in the universe.</p>
            <p>Cosmologists have combined the big bang theory with the inflationary theory to produce a new picture of the universe’s evolution.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="B">
            <p>To find the main idea, here’s all you need to read:</p>
            <div class="custom_list" id="div208">
              <p>“In that case, the mean density of matter in the universe would be about 15 orders of magnitude greater than its present value, which is about 10<sup>-29</sup> grams per cubic centimeter.”</p>
            </div>
            <p>Given these sentences, how might you paraphrase the main idea? That the big bang theory may be wrong and that the inflationary theory may be right? Now you can go to the answer choices.</p>
            <p>Eliminate (A) because it’s too extreme. Scientists haven’t <em>proven</em> the big bang theory wrong. Leave (B) in because it’s a good match for your paraphrase. Also, note how moderate (B) is. Eliminate (C) because it says the inflationary theory is bad. Remember, it’s the big bang theory that’s problematic, not the inflationary theory. Eliminate (D) because it mentions stuff (magnetic monopoles) you didn’t read about. Eliminate (E) because it suggests the big bang theory is okay. The best answer, then, is (B).</p>

          <div class="question">
            <p>The tone of the passage can best be described as</p>

            <p>largely nostalgic but also critical</p>
            <p>largely concerned but also amused</p>

            <p>largely appreciative but also modest</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="D">
            <p>Most of the passage provides information about the big bang and complications that arise from the theory. However, in the beginning of the first two paragraphs, the authors express hope that their new theory will resolve these complications. Thus, (D) is correct. Choices (A) and (C) are wrong because the authors are not nostalgic or indifferent. While the authors may be concerned about the problems associated with the big bang, the overall tone of the passage is not one of concern. In any event, the authors are not amused, eliminating (B). While the authors do appear to appreciate their new theory of inflation, (E) is too strong: The passage as a whole is not largely appreciative, but, rather, mostly informative.</p>

            <p>A new theory is introduced, a reason for the proposal of that theory is generally described, and certain shortcomings of an older theory are discussed.</p>
            <p>A new theory is introduced, a reason for the proposal of that theory is generally described, and an older theory is discarded.</p>
            <p>A new theory is introduced, and the reasons for the discarding of an old theory are described.</p>
            <p>A new theory is introduced; the evidence supporting that theory is described.</p>
            <p>A new theory is introduced, criticism of that theory is considered, and the new theory is further refined.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="explanation" data-answer="A">
            <p>Rather than dealing with one answer at a time, start by looking at the first statement of each answer. They are all the same, and they are accurate: The first paragraph introduces the recent theory of inflation. Next, look at the second statement of each answer. Choices (A) and (B) work best: The beginning of the second paragraph explains that the inflation theory was developed to address complications arising from the big bang theory. Choice (C) is wrong because the authors did not say that the big bang theory was discarded, (D) is wrong because no supporting evidence is provided, and (E) is wrong because the authors do not discuss criticism of the inflation theory. Finally, look at the last statement in (A) and (B). Choice (A) is correct because the remainder of the passage describes the big bang theory and shortcomings of that theory. Choice (B) is too strong; the authors seek to supplement, not discard, the big bang theory.</p>

            <p>This tone question is specific, not general. Regardless, for any tone question, extreme answer choices are bad. What answer choices are too extreme here? Definitely (D), so cross it out. The other answer choices are fairly moderate, so leave them in for now. What now? Use “dynasties” as your lead word. That takes you to the first paragraph. How does the author feel about the formation of the dynasties? Not too good: She calls them an “abominable elite that had developed as a consequence of social prejudice.” So what’s the best answer? Something that’s slightly negative. Eliminate (A) because it’s positive. Eliminate (B) because it’s not negative at all. Keep (C) for now because it’s slightly negative. Finally, leave in (E) because it’s slightly negative.</p>
            <p>The remaining answer choices are (C) and (E). Which one is better? Well, does the author dislike the formation of the dynasties or is she resigned to it? She dislikes it, right? So the best answer is (C).</p>

            <p>This is a specific question. Use “United States” as your lead words. Once you find the lead words, remember to read about five lines above and five lines below. So where is “United States”? In the second paragraph. What does the passage say about men in the United States? That they took a “ ‘protective’ stance” toward women to compensate them for their “nonexistent social status.” Always make a paraphrase of the answer before moving on to the answer choices.</p>
            <p>Eliminate (A) because who cares about the Court d’Assizes. Keep (B) because it looks like a pretty good match for your paraphrase. Eliminate (C) because you didn’t read anything about a popular movement. Eliminate (D) because who cares about the modern historians. Eliminate (E) because you didn’t read anything about lots of French women being guillotined. The best answer is (B).</p>

            <p>The passage suggests that, during the French Revolution, popular arguments against the death penalty did which of the following?</p>

            <p>Emphasized the failure of the death penalty to suppress dissent</p>

            <p>This is a specific question. Use “death penalty” as your lead words. Once you find the lead words, don’t forget to read about five lines above and five lines below. So where is “death penalty”? In the third paragraph. What does the passage say about popular arguments against the death penalty? That they focus on humanitarian principles and that they don’t focus on equal rights. In other words, men and women are equal, so if women aren’t subject to capital punishment, then men shouldn’t be either. It’s important that you paraphrase the answer to the question before moving on to the answer choices.</p>
            <p>Eliminate (A) because it doesn’t talk about humanitarian principles or equal rights. Eliminate (B) for the same reason. Eliminate (C) because it misinterprets information in the passage. Popular arguments <em>failed</em> to incorporate equal rights. Eliminate (D) because it also misrepresents information in the passage. It’s the men that are getting killed, not the women. Keep (E) because it’s a good match for your paraphrase. Choice (E) is the best answer.</p>

            <p>The support for the answer to this primary purpose question is provided by the statement in the passage that “the two decades before the civil war witnessed the development of conflicting…ideologies…each viewing…the other as…a threat to its existence.” Choice (A) can be eliminated because the word “requirement” is extreme language that is not supported by the text, which states that such a view “may be justly questioned.” Choice (C) is a memory trap, referencing “consciously non-ideological…political parties,” and can be eliminated because the passage does not spell out the reason this choice is made. Choice (D) is a reversal, as the passage focuses on “the two decades before the Civil War.” Choice (E) is a reversal, as the passage provides support that each party “grew in part as a response to the growth of the other.” The correct answer is choice (B).</p>

Choice (D) is recycled language, as the passage provides no connection between modern political parties and the Civil War. Choice (E) can be eliminated, because the word “only” is extreme language that is not supported by the text, which states “consciously non-ideological” without indication of what the parties address.

Choice (B) can be eliminated, because the word “characterized” is extreme language that is not supported by the text, which only provides for a reason “the minority can accept the victory of the majority.” Choice (C) is a reversal, as the passage provides support for the idea that political parties may wish to discuss only issues that are not divisive, but not that the democracy as a whole should do so.

Choice (B) is a memory trap, as the passage references both the influx of women workers and that women in corporations may be noticed and scrutinized more than their male counterparts simply by virtue of their numerical rarity. Choice (D) is a memory trap, as the passage references extreme segregation and refers to different evaluations of men and women with the qualities “that are highly praised in one sex are sometimes denigrated in the other.” Choice (E) is a memory trap, as the passage refers to the majority of female bakers as “found in highly automated baking industries, while their male counterparts are located in less automated bakeries,” which does not necessarily indicate a difference in pay.

          <p>If my colleagues and l are right, we may soon be saying good—bye to the idea that our universe was a single fireball created in the big bang. We are exploring a new theory based on a 15-year-old notion that the universe went through a stage of inflation. During that time, the theory holds, the Cosmos became exponentially large within an infinitesimal fraction of a second. At the end of this period, the universe continued its evolution according to the big bang model. As workers refined this inflationary scenario, they uncovered some surprising consequences. One of them constitutes a fundamental change in how the cosmos is seen. Recent versions of inflationary theory assert that instead of being an expanding ball of fire the universe is a huge, growing fractal. It consists of many inflating balls that produce more balls, which in turn produce more balls, ad infinitum.</p>
          <p> Cosmologists did not arbitrarily invent this rather peculiar vision of the universe. Several workers, first in Russia and later in the U.S., proposed the inflationary hypothesis that is the basis of its foundation. We did so to solve some of the complications left by the old big bang theory. In its standard form, the big bang theory maintains that the universe was born about 15 billion years ago from a cosmological singularity—a state in which the temperature and density are infinitely high. Of course, one cannot really speak in physical terms about these quantities as being infinite. One usually assumes that the current laws of physics did not apply then. They took hold only after the density of the universe dropped below the so—called Planck density, which equals about 10<sup>94</sup> grams per cubic Centimeter.</p>
          <p> As the universe expanded, it gradually cooled.Remnants of the primordial cosmic fire still surround us in the form of the microwave background radiation.</p>
          <p>This radiation indicates that the temperature of the universe has dropped to 2.7 kelvins. The 1965 discovery of this background radiation proved to be the crucial evidence in establishing the big bang theory as the preeminent theory of cosmology. The big bang theory also explained the abundances of hydrogen, helium, and other elements in the universe.</p>
          <p> As investigators developed the theory, they uncovered complications. For example, the standard big bang theory, coupled with the modern theory of elementary particles, predicts the existence of many super—heavy particles carrying magnetic charge—that is, objects that have only one magnetic pole. These magnetic monopoles would have a typical mass 10<sup>16</sup> times that of the proton, or about 0.00001 milligram. According to the standard big bang theory, monopoles should have emerged very early in the evolution of the universe and should now be as abundant as protons. in that case, the mean density of matter in the universe would be about 15 orders of magnitude greater than its present value, which is about 10<sup>-29</sup> grams per cubic centimeter.</p>

          <p>The feminists of revolutionary France were not the only persons hoping that the current paroxysm of social change would bring about improvement of their state. A most singular category of men, the public executioners, had thought that the advent of a new regime would transform that peculiar disdain in which society held them. For hundreds of years, the post of Master of the High Works in France's major cities was held by men from ten or so dynastic families, members of an abominable elite that had developed as a Consequence of social prejudice: Anyone who had ever been a <i>bourreau</i> could never hope to find another job, nor COU|d he aspire to marry any woman not herself the daughter of a colleague. In this way the dreadful dynasties developed. The best known recipients of this peculiar distinction were the Sanson family, who operated in Paris and Versailles from 1688 to 1847; the diary kept by Charles Henri Sanson, executioner of Paris during the Terror, provides details of the deaths of many illustrious victims.</p>
          <p>Several passages in the Sanson diary suggest that professional executioners did not particularly like having to kill women. This chivalrous repugnance later spread through the Court d'Assizes; while women were regularly condemned to death in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in fact they were almost always reprieved. A roughly contemporaneous reluctance to execute women in the United States has been explained by recent American feminists as evidence of women's almost nonexistent social status at that time; to compensate for legal inegality the men who were women's judges, prosecutors, and jurors adopted a "protective" stance, frequently acquitting women who, in modern retrospect, seem guilty. in France the egalitarian practices of earlier centuries were ultimately reinstated, which guillotined five women.</p>
          <p> This temporary preservation of execution as an exclusively male domain—a thing too necessary and revolting to be inflicted on or endured by half the population—apparently did not strike legislators as being intolerably illogical, or as being rather a back- handed sort of compliment to men. Proper equality would have involved either equal rights and equal punishment for men and women, or else abolition. However, arguments against the death penalty tend rather to develop from general humanitarian principles, and less from the putative equality of women.</p>
          <p> Chivalry, indeed, would seem to have been the nineteenth century's solution to the problems posed to the authorities by "female" executions. But more importantly, chivalry enabled society to observe a version of that logic set forth in 1791 by Olympe de Gouges, a logic echoed later in the United States by Wendell Phillips, who bluntly declared, "You have granted that women may be hung; therefore you must grant that woman may vote." In not executing women, the judiciary body was able to sidestep these irritating formulations: If women did not receive equal punishment under law, perhaps they need not be assured of equal rights.</p>

          <p>Political parties today are consciously non- ideological, but in the 1840s and 1850s ideology made its way into the heart of the political system. Political sociologists have pointed out that the stable functioning of a political democracy requires a setting in which parties represent broad coalitions of varying interests, and that the peaceful resolution of social conflict takes place most easily when the major parties share fundamental values. Such a view implies that the peaceful operation of the political system is the highest social value, an implication which, under certain circumstances, may be justly questioned. But it does contain important insights about the normal functioning of the American polity. Government by majority rule, Carl Becker observed many years ago, works best when political issues involve superficial problems, rather than deep social divisions. The minority can accept the victory of the majority at the polls, because both share many basic values, and electoral defeat does not imply "a fatal surrender of vital interests.”</p>
          <p>Before the 1850s, the second American party system conformed to this pattern—largely because sectional ideologies and issues were consciously kept out of politics. In this sense, the party system had a certain artificial quality. lts divisions rarely corresponded to the basic sectional divisions which were daily becoming more and more pronounced. The two decades before the Civil War witnessed the development of conflicting sectional ideologies, each viewing its own society as fundamentally well- ordered, and the other as both a negation of its most cherished values and a threat to its existence.</p>
          <p>The development of the two ideologies was in many ways interrelated; each grew in part as a response to the growth of the other. Thus, as southerners were coming more and more consciously to insist on slavery as the very basis of civilized life, and to reject the materialism and lack of cohesion in northern society, northerners came to view slavery as the antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests.</p>
          <p>The existing political system could not contain these two irreconcilable ideologies, and in the 1850s each national party—Whigs, Know—Nothings, and finally Democrats—disintegrated. And in the end the South seceded from the Union rather than accept the victory of a political party whose ideology threatened everything Southerners most valued.</p>
          <p> At the center of the Republican ideology was the notion of "free labor.” This concept involved not merely an attitude toward work, but a justification of antebellum northern society, and it led northern Republicans to an extensive critique of southern society, which appeared both different from and inferior to their own. Republicans also believed in the existence of a conspiratorial "slave power" which had seized control of the federal government. Two profoundly different and antagonistic civilizations, Republicans thus believed, had developed within the nation, and were competing for control of the political system.</p>

          <p>ln Anglo—AmeriCan formalism, surrealism was considered a deviant art movement: improperly visual and impertinently literary, relatively inattentiveto the imperatives of form, and mostly indifferent to the laws of genre, a paradoxical avant—garde concerned with infantile states and outmoded forms, not properly modernist at all. For neo—avant—garde artists who challenged this hegemony three decades ago, its very deviance might have made surrealism an attractive object. But such was not the case.</p>
          <p>Since this formalist model of modernism was staked on the autonomy of modern art as separate from social practice and grounded in visual experience, its antagonist, the neo—avant—garde account of modernism, stressed the two movements, dada and constructivism, that appeared most opposed to this visualist autonomy—that sought to destroy the separate institution of art in an anarchic attack on its formal conventions, as did dada, or to transform it according to the materialist practices of a revolutionary society, as did constructivism. Again surrealism was lost in the shuffle. To the neo—avant— gardists who challenged the formalist account in the 1950s and 1960s, it too appeared corrupt: technically kitschy, philosophically subjective, hypocritically elitist. Hence when artists involved in pop and minimalism turned away from the likes of Picasso and Matisse, they turned to such figures as Duchamp and Rodchenko, not to precedents like Ernst and Giacometti.</p>

          <p>E. M. Forster is an Edwardian in point of time, and he is equally so in spirit. His outlook on the world and his literary manner were already thoroughlydeveloped in that epoch and have passed through the subsequent years of turbulence and cataclysm with remarkably little modification. The various modern revolutions in physics, in psychology, in politics, even in literary style, have not escaped his intelligent notice, but they can scarcely be said to have influenced him deeply. His response to the explosion of the Victorian dream of benevolent progress has been a modest and orderly retreat to safer ground— to a tolerant individualism now unmixed with Utopian dreams, but nevertheless closer to Victorian ideals than to any of the popular creeds of today. Rather than conform to bad times, Forster prefers to remind us cheerfully that his views are atavistic.</p>
          <p> The strength of Fcrster’s resistance to the twentieth century is especially apparent when we place him beside some of his fellow writers. If Joyce, Lawrence, Pound, and the early Eliot represent the main current of the modern literary movement in English, we must admit that Forster's private stream runs in an older ohannel. These others were radical ioonoolasts whose rejection of bourgeois—democratic life was violent and shattering. Equally shattering was their fragmentation of the polite cadences of Victorian literature. In seeing the falseness of the old psychology, they conceived a scorn for the /7y,0ocr/te /ecteur; their role as apocalyptic prophets, as naysayers to the boredom and specious rationality of modern life, demanded that they be obscure and idiosyncratic. Forster, in contrast, unashamedly calls himself a bourgeois and remains faithful to the tradition of calm intelligibility.</p>
          <p> He is anti—apocalyptic in both his politics and his literary sense. To some degree his novels return us to the congenial Victorian relationship between writer and reader, with its unspoken agreement over the usefulness of the sociable virtues and its apotheosis of the happy family. Though Forster’s heroes struggle against "sooiety” as a body of inhibitions, their revolt is never truly radical. And Forster’s ironioal style, though it is unsparing in its probing at shams and half-truths, presupposes a confidence in the reader's sympathy and good judgment—a confidence that seemed quite archaic to the other writers named.</p>
          <p>Forster’s resistance to modernity may account for the fact that his novels, though they are almost universally esteemed, have never won him a cult of fanatical disciples. With a few exceptions, critics have tended to explicate and admire his works without becoming heated over the possible merit of his ideas. Yet Forster decidedly is a novelist of ideas, and didactic moral content is hardly less conspicuous in his work than in Lawrence's. Forster’s persistent "moral" is that the life of affectionate personal relations, disengaged from political and religious zeal by means of a tolerant ecleotioism, is supremely valuable. This is not a stirring creed; in fact, it is a warning against allowing oneself to be stirred by any creed.</p>

          <p>Natural selection is an immensely powerful yet beautifully simple theory that has held up remarkably well, under intense and unrelenting scrutiny and testing, for 135 years. In essence, natural selection locates the mechanism of evolutionary change in a ''struggle’’ among organisms for reproductive success, leading to improved fit of populations to changing environments . . .</p>
          <p>Yet powerful though the principle may be . . . natural selection is not fully sufficient to explain evolutionary change. First, many other causes are powerful, particularly at levels of biological organization both above and below the traditional Darwinian focus on organisms and their struggle for reproductive success. At the lowest level of substitution in individual base pairs of DNA, change is often effectively neutral and therefore random.</p>
          <p>At higher levels, involving entire species or faunas, punctuated equilibrium can produce evolutionary trends by selection of species based on their rates of origin and extirpation, whereas mass extinctions wipe out substantial parts of biotas for reasons unrelated to adaptive struggles of constituent species in ”normal" times between such events.</p>
          <p> Second . . . no matter how adequate our general theory of evolutionary change, we also yearn to document and understand the actual pathway of life's history. Theory, of course, is relevant to explaining the pathway . . . But the actual pathway is strongly underdeterm/'neo’ by our general theory of life's evolution. This point needs some belaboring . . . Webs and chains of historical events are so intricate, so imbued with random and chaotic elements, so unrepeatable in encompassing such a multitude of unique (and uniquely interacting) objects, that standard models of simple prediction and replication do not apply.</p>
          <p> History can be explained—with satisfying rigor if evidence be adequate—after a sequence of events unfolds, but it cannot be predicted with any precision beforehand . . . History includes too much chaos, or extremely sensitive dependence on minute and unmeasurable differences in initial conditions, leading to massively divergent outcomes based on tiny and unknowable disparities in starting points. And history includes too much contingency, or shaping of present results by long chains of unpredictable antecedent states, rather than immediate determination by timeless laws of nature.</p>
          <p> Homo sa,o/ens did not appear on the earth, just a geologic second ago, because evolutionary theory predicts such an outcome based on themes of progress and increasing neural complexity. Humans arose, rather, as a fortuitous and contingent outcome of thousands of linked events, any one of which could have occurred differently and sent history on an alternative pathway that would not have led to consciousness . . .</p>
          <p>Therefore, to understand the events and generalities of life's pathway, we must go beyond principles of evolutionary theory to a paleontological examination of the contingent pattern of life's history on our planet—the single actualized version among millions of plausible alternatives that happened not to occur.</p>
          <p> Such a view of life's history is highly contrary both to conventional deterministic models of Western science and to the deepest social traditions and psychological hopes of Western culture for a history culminating in humans as life's highest expression and intended planetary steward.</p>

          <p>Occupations foster gender differences among workers in a variety of ways, one of the most pervasive being "interna| stratification." That is, men and women in the same occupation often perform different tasks and functions. Even in those occupations that appear sexually integrated, the aggregate statistics often mask extreme internal segregation. Although the proportion of female bakers increased from 25 percent in 1970 to 41 percent in 1980, for example, the majority of female bakers are found in highly automated baking industries, while their male counterparts are located in less automated bakeries. The same phenomenon has been detected among pharmacists, financial managers, and bus drivers—a|| groups where the influx of women workers suggests a diminution of sex segregation.</p>
          <p>Another strategy used to maintain gender differences in supposedly integrated occupations is the use of sumptuary and etiquette rules. When women enter male—dominated occupations, certain rules are often introduced to govern their dress and demeanor. In office settings, for instance, dress codes—either formal or imp|icit—are not unusual; female employees may be required to wear dresses, nylons, and high—heeled shoes to enhance their femininity. So it is for female marines and male nurses, both of whom are required to dress differently from their male and female Counterparts.</p>
          <p> l\/lale nurses never wear the traditional nursing cap; female marines never sport the standard Marine Corps garrison cap.</p>
          <p>Informal practices also play a role in constituting femininity in female marines anol masculinity in male nurses. As members of visible minority groups, they stand out at work and receive far more than their fair share of attention. This phenomenon was first documented by Rosabeth |\/loss Kanter, who found that women in corporations, simply by virtue of their numerical rarity, were noticed and scrutinized more than their male counterparts. This added pressure may actually result in different job performances from men and women in nontraditional occupations and exacerbate gender differences. Kanter's corporate women, for example, became more secretive, less independent, and less oppositional in response to their greater visibility—all traits that have traditionally been associated with femininity.</p>
          <p> Another informal technique that enhances gender differences is practiced by supervisors who evaluate men and women differently. The very qualities that are highly praised in one sex are sometimes denigrated in the other. Thus, a man is "ambitious,” a woman, "pushy"; a woman is "sensitive," a man, "wimpy." But it would be a mistake to claim that all gender differences are forced on people. In addition to the external pressures I have just described, male nurses and female marines actively construct their own gender by redefining their activities in terms of traditional masculine and feminine traits. For example, women in the Marine Corps insist that their femininity is intact even as they march cadence in camouflage units. Likewise, male nurses contend that their masculinity is not at all threatened while they care for and nurture their patients.</p>

          <p>Although meningitis clone lll—l has caused hundreds of thousands of meningitis cases, it does not appear to be uniquely virulent. Now that it is possible to perform clonal analysis of meningooocoal strains, it is clear that other clones have caused similar epidemics in Africa and Asia. These findings do suggest, however, that the introduction of a potentially epidemic clone under the right circumstances can be devastating. Two explanations have been given for this process: Epidemic clones randomly expand as they progress through a population, or they survive by escaping herd immunity. As an analogy to influenza outbreaks, it has been proposed that epidemics might result from what are called antigenic shifts.</p>
          <p> Although all serogrcup A meningocccci share the same pclysaccharide, individual clones differ in the other antigens exposed on the cell surface. Once immunity to the shared antigens wanes, a new clone with sufficiently different surface antigens might escape immune surveillance and start an epidemic.</p>
          <p>Epidemiologists following disease patterns will then see an "antigenic: shift" as new clones supersede older clones.</p>

          <p>New York stood at the center of the momentous processes that recast American society in the nineteenth century. Once a modest seaport, the city early took the lead in developing new forms of commerce and mass production; by 1860 it was both the nation's premier port and its largest manufacturing city. The appearance of new social classes was both cause and result of industrial development and commercial expansion. Wealth from investments in trade and manufacturing ventures supported the emergence of an urban bourgeoisie; the expansion of capitalist labor arrangements brought into being a class of largely impoverished wageworkers. The resulting divisions fostered, on each side, new and antagonistic political ideas and social practices.</p>
          <p>We know most about the male participants in these conflicts, workingmen and employers. Politically, bourgeois men upheld their right to protect, improve upon, and increase the private property on which rested, they believed, their country's welfare. In return, many workingmen affirmed a belief in the superior abilities of those who worked with their hands—as opposed to the idle, acquisitive, parasitical owners of property—to direct American society in accordance with republican values of social equality, civil virtue, and yeomanry that they inherited from the Revolution.</p>
          <p> Class transformation was related to, but not synonymous with, the thorough—going transformation of the gender system in the first half of the nineteenth century: that is, the changes in all those arrangements of work, sexuality, parental responsibilities, psychological life, assigned social traits, and internalized emotions through which the sexes defined themselves respectively as men and women. Women of the emerging bourgeoisie articulated new ideas about many of these aspects of their lives. Designating themselves moral guardians of their husbands and children, women became the standard—bearers of piety, decorum, and virtue in Northern society. They claimed the home as the sphere of society where they could most effectively exercise their power. In their consignment to the household as the sole domain of proper female activity, women suffered a constriction of their social engagements; at the same time, they gained power within their families that also vested them with greater moral authority in their own communities.</p>
          <p> While the cult of domesticity spoke to female interests and emerged from altered relations between men and women, it also contained within it conflicts of class. As urban ladies increased their contacts with the working poor through Protestant missions and charity work, they developed domestic ideology as part of a vision of a reformed city, purged of the supposed perfidies of working—o|ass life. Domestioity quickly became an element of bourgeois self- oonsoiousness. In confronting the working poor, reformers created and refined their own sense of themselves as social and spiritual superiors capable of remolding the city in their own image. From the ideas and practices of domesticity they drew many of the materials for their ideal of a society that had put to rest the disturbing conflicts of class.</p>

          <p>The societies in which shamanism has flourished have been small, relatively se|f—sufficient social systems which see themselves as coping directly with their natural worlds. Like all human beings, the members of such groups lived in a world of uncertainty. The presence of a person who could maintain contact with the cosmic forces of the universe directly, who could make sense of both the measured order of ordinary times and the catastrophes of drought, earthquake, or flood, was of incalculable value.</p>
          <p>More complex social systems tend to have "institutionalized" specialists who transmit information without explicit recourse to the supernatural. Such societies have priests and prophets, not shamans, at the overt level. But the line between shaman anol prophet is tenuous. The prophet usually does not enjoy the legitimacy within his society that is granted the shaman. His is a voice crying in the wilderness, not that of the legitimate ourer and philosopher. Despite these differences, the prophet can be seen as a kind of shaman, and thus the study of shamanism illuminates some of the obsourities in religious traditions.</p>

          <p>In a study, scientists dissected the brains of 10,000 recently deceased people who were all of similar ages and backgrounds. To minimize the risk of contamination and ensure optimal visual analysis of the brain tissue, the scientists washed the tissue before staining it for analysis. The scientists found that the brain tissue of deceased patients with Alzheimer's disease contained unusually high concentrations of aluminum. The aluminum was found in tissues that had lesions oontaining amyloid protein, a protein that damages nerve cells and has previously been shown to cause Alzheimer's. The scientists hypothesized that Alzheimer's disease results when amyloid protein grows in lesions caused by excess aluminum in the brain.</p>

          <p>Some economists have argued that market regulation is antithetical to the ideal functioning of a democratic society because it interferes withthe individual’s right to make decisions in his own financial interest. In a regulated market, the citizen is not always at liberty to choose where or how to build his house or whom to hire for his business. If all individuals do not have complete freedom to make economic decisions purely with respect to their own self—interest, then a society is not a true democracy.</p>
          <p>Yet this perspective overlooks the fact that the democratic ideal encompasses two separate, but not mutually exclusive goals: 1) to ensure individual liberty and 2) to promote the overall health and well- being of the population. Some degree of market regulation may be necessary to fulfill the latter goal, for an individual’s exercise of his own liberty can in some instances interfere with the liberty of others.</p>
