            <p>The blank is describing what <em>her eyes relayed</em> and the transition word <em>despite</em> indicates that what <em>her eyes relayed</em> must be the opposite <em>the smile that spread from ear to ear.</em> A good word for the blank is something like “sadness.” Choice (A), <em>jubilance,</em> means something joyous, so eliminate it. Choice (B), <em>sorrow</em>, is a good match, so keep (B). <em>Lively</em> means energetic, so eliminate (C). <em>[V]ision</em> offers no contrast to “sadness,” and <em>mischievousness</em> or naughtiness is closer to <em>smile</em> than to “sadness,” so eliminate (D) and (E).

            <p>The blank is describing <em>black bears…claws.</em> The transition word <em>[w]hile</em> indicates that the <em>claws of black bears</em> are different from those of <em>grizzly bears</em> which are described as <em>long, flat, and somewhat blunt.</em> Black bears’ claws are described in the sentence as <em>short</em> and <em>curved,</em> which are the opposite of <em>long</em> and <em>flat.</em> Therefore, a good word for the blank is the opposite of <em>somewhat blunt,</em> so use “sharp” and evaluate the answer choices. Choice (A) <em>obtuse</em> is a synonym for blunt, so eliminate (A). Choice (B), <em>abominable</em> may describe a bear, but the word doesn’t mean “sharp” and so doesn’t match the clue, eliminate (B). Choice (C), <em>barren,</em> is not a match for “sharp” so eliminate it. Choice (D), <em>acute,</em> is a good match for “sharp,” so keep (D). Choice (C), <em>fearful</em> does not match “sharp,” so eliminate it. The correct answer is (D).</p>

            <p>The blank is describing <em>individual personalities.</em> The semicolon indicates that the clause before the semicolon should agree with the clause following it. Therefore, the duality of <em>stability versus change</em> must be matched in the second clause by the duality describing <em>personalities—</em>the word in the blank or <em>different.</em> The adjective <em>different</em> in the second clause corresponds to <em>change</em> in the first, so the word in the blank must be an adjective corresponding to <em>stability.</em> Recycle from the clue and use “stable.” Choice (A) <em>transient,</em> means last for a short period of time, so eliminate (A). Choice (B), <em>maladjusted</em> is not a match for “stable” so eliminate it. Choice (C), <em>static,</em> is a good match for the “stable” so keep (C). Choice (D), <em>disturbed,</em> and (E), <em>discreet,</em> are both not poor matches for “stable,” so eliminate (D) and (E). The correct answer is (C).</p>

              <strong>futile</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The clue is “global interconnectedness on the rise.” In such a situation, the United States might allow its own interests to be harmed if it tried to stay neutral during wartime. Thus, you need a word that means <em>doomed</em> for the blank. Something <em>presumptuous</em> is not necessarily doomed, while <em>pragmatic</em> and <em>admirable</em> take the sentence in the wrong direction. <em>Contemptuous</em>, in contrast, makes no sense in the blank’s context. <em>Futile</em> is the best choice.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Choose carefully here. The clue is “the dancers alone made his trip worthwhile.” Thus, Flaubert was impressed by them. <em>Enamored of</em> is the only choice that captures such a feeling. <em>Overwhelmed by</em> is extreme, and implies that Flaubert got into more than he could handle. <em>Taken aback by,</em> in contrast, merely suggests that our traveler was surprised by the dancers; we cannot be sure that his surprise was pleasant. Meanwhile, <em>beseeched by</em> does not indicate how Flaubert felt, whereas if he were <em>flustered by</em> the performers, he would not likely have found his encounter with them <em>worthwhile</em></p>

              <strong>fragile</strong> and <strong>E vulnerability</strong></p>
            <p>Try working with the second blank first. The clue is “facade of calm that covers our anxiety.” The transition <em>and</em> tells you that you are going in the same direction. Therefore, the word in the second blank should be something similar to <em>anxiety</em><em>Vulnerability</em> is the best fit. Nothing in the sentence supports a word as strong as <em>terror</em>, and <em>humor</em> goes in the wrong direction. For the first blank, if our facade is “flimsy and effortlessly ruptured,” it is likely that the human race is <em>delicate</em><em>Fragile</em> is the only choice that matches.</p>

              <strong>fulfilled, F changes,</strong> and <strong>H perilously</strong></p>
            <p>Try working with the first blank first. The clue for the first blank is “predictions generally…accurate.” The transition <em>however</em> tells you that the first and second parts of the sentence are in contrast to each other. Predictions are usually right, the first part of the sentence is saying, when things go as normal. Put something like <em>true</em> in the first blank. <em>Fulfilled</em> fits nicely. The second and third blank must be filled together in order to complete the second sentence. The transition <em>however</em> shows that the second sentence changes direction. You would expect predictions to be wrong when there are <em>changes</em>, which is a choice for the second blank. <em>Substantial changes</em> would make predictions <em>very</em> wrong, so <em>perilously</em> is the best choice.</p>

Characteristics <em>which arise through experience</em> correspond to <em>nurture,</em> so the characteristics described by the blank should correspond to <em>nature,</em> so use “natural” as the word for the blank. <em>Intractable</em> is a poor match for “natural” so eliminate (A).

        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p>Called by some the “island that time forgot,” Madagascar is home to a vast array of unique, exotic creatures. One such animal is the aye-aye. First described by western science in 1782, it was initially categorized as a member of the order Rodentia. Further research then revealed that it was more closely related to the lemur, a member of the primate order. Since the aye-aye is so different from its fellow primates, however, it was given its own family: <em>Daubentoniidae</em>. The aye-aye has been listed as an endangered species and, as a result, the government of Madagascar has designated an island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar as a protected reserve for aye-ayes and other wildlife.</p>
          <p>Long before Western science became enthralled with this nocturnal denizen of Madagascar’s jungles, the aye-aye had its own reputation with the local people. The aye-aye is perhaps best known for its large, round eyes and long, extremely thin middle finger. These adaptations are quite sensible, allowing the aye-aye to see well at night and retrieve grubs, which are one of its primary food sources, from deep within hollow branches. However, the aye-aye’s striking appearance may end up causing its extinction. The people of Madagascar believe that the aye-aye is a type of spirit animal, and that its appearance is an omen of death. Whenever one is sighted, it is immediately killed. When combined with the loss of large swaths of jungle habitat, this practice may result in the loss of <span data-question="question15">a superb example of life’s variety.</span></p>

It states that the aye-aye is seen as an omen of death in the traditional religion of Madagascar. <em>Augury</em> refers to the use of omens, so this statement must be true. Choice (C), however, is not supported. Although the passage states that the aye-aye is in danger, it does not directly discuss whether this is due to limited resources on the main island.</p>

          <p>Published in 1982, the novel draws deeply on the author’s own family history. Allende is the first cousin once removed of former Chilean president Salvador Allende, who was murdered during a right-wing military coup in 1973. Yet rather than the to-be-expected socialist harangue, Allende subtly works her political message within the fabric of the compelling narrative she weaves. While Allende borrows a bit too freely from Gabriel García Márquez’s work, she nevertheless has a powerful and original voice within the construct of magical realism.</p>

            <p>The passage states, “rather than the to-be-expected socialist harangue, Allende subtly works her political message within the fabric of the compelling narrative she weaves.” In other words, a reader might have expected Allende to include strong socialist propaganda within her novel, but she did not. Choice (A) is incorrect. Although the passage talks about Allende’s background, it is not clear that her novel is autobiographical in nature. Choice (B) is incorrect because although the passage states that Allende’s work would have received more critical attention if the book had been thought of as great literature, it is not clear that it would have received more favorable reviews. Choice (C) is incorrect because although the passage states that Allende borrowed from García Márquez’s work, it does not state that she learned magical realism from García Márquez. Choice (D) is the opposite of what the passage argues. The passage suggests that it is the very subtlety of her political message that makes Allende’s work compelling.</p>

For (A), the numbers of similar companies in regions with favorable tax policies compared with the numbers in regions with unfavorable tax policies does not explain why there was less corporate flight. The reference to numbers is out of scope. For (C), both the difficulty of the codes and the benefit to anyone other than the company are irrelevant. Though the tax codes may have been difficult to decipher, saving money would still have been good incentive to move.
