Since the question centers on how <em>Laura…might be considered, the contrast applies to how the company would feel about hiring Laura,</em> and a <em>lack of experience</em> is negative, so the type of <em>Salary</em> that would be considered positive is a “low” one, so use that as a word for the third blank.

          <div class="choices">
            <p>Scientists have proven the big bang theory to be inaccurate and replaced it with the concept that the universe inflated over time.</p>
            <p>Because the big bang theory cannot account for the actual state of the universe, it is possible that the universe actually evolved through inflation.</p>
            <p>The big bang theory cannot be discounted completely, but the inflationary theory is also plagued by inconsistencies.</p>
            <p>The big bang theory is incorrect because of the absence of magnetic monopoles in the universe.</p>
            <p>Cosmologists have combined the big bang theory with the inflationary theory to produce a new picture of the universe’s evolution.</p>

            <p><span>
                <strong>B</strong>
              </span>To find the main idea, here’s all you need to read:</p>
            <p><span>• </span>“If my colleagues and I are right, we may soon be saying good-bye to the idea that our universe was a single fireball created in the big bang. We are exploring a new theory based on a 15-year-old notion that the universe went through a stage of inflation.”</p>

            <p>Given these sentences, how might you paraphrase the main idea? That the big bang theory may be wrong and that the inflationary theory may be right? Now you can go to the answer choices.</p>
            <p>Eliminate (A) because it’s too extreme. Scientists haven’t <em>proven</em> the big bang theory wrong. Leave (B) in because it’s a good match for your paraphrase. Also, note how moderate (B) is. Eliminate (C) because it says the inflationary theory is bad. Remember, it’s the big bang theory that’s problematic, not the inflationary theory. Eliminate (D) because it mentions stuff (magnetic monopoles) you didn’t read about. Eliminate (E) because it suggests the big bang theory is okay. The best answer, then, is (B).</p>

        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p>If my colleagues and l are right, we may soon be saying goodbye to the idea that our universe was a single fireball created in the big bang. We are exploring a new theory based on a 15-year-old notion that the universe went through a stage of inflation. During that time, the theory holds, the Cosmos became exponentially large within an infinitesimal fraction of a second. At the end of this period, the universe continued its evolution according to the big bang model. As workers refined this inflationary scenario, they uncovered some surprising consequences. One of them constitutes a fundamental change in how the cosmos is seen. Recent versions of inflationary theory assert that instead of being an expanding ball of fire the universe is a huge, growing fractal. It consists of many inflating balls that produce more balls, which in turn produce more balls, ad infinitum.</p>
          <p> Cosmologists did not arbitrarily invent this rather peculiar vision of the universe. Several workers, first in Russia and later in the U.S., proposed the inflationary hypothesis that is the basis of its foundation. We did so to solve some of the complications left by the old big bang theory. In its standard form, the big bang theory maintains that the universe was born about 15 billion years ago from a cosmological singularityâ€”a state in which the temperature and density are infinitely high. Of course, one cannot really speak in physical terms about these quantities as being infinite. One usually assumes that the current laws of physics did not apply then. They took hold only after the density of the universe dropped below the soâ€”called Planck density, which equals about 10<sup>94</sup> grams per cubic Centimeter.</p>
          <p> As the universe expanded, it gradually cooled. Remnants of the primordial cosmic fire still surround us in the form of the microwave background radiation. This radiation indicates that the temperature of the universe has dropped to 2.7 kelvins. The 1965 discovery of this background radiation proved to be the crucial evidence in establishing the big bang theory as the preeminent theory of cosmology. The big bang theory also explained the abundances of hydrogen, helium, and other elements in the universe. As investigators developed the theory, they uncovered complications. For example, the standard big bang theory, coupled with the modern theory of elementary particles, predicts the existence of many superâ€”heavy particles carrying magnetic chargeâ€”that is, objects that have only one magnetic pole. These magnetic monopoles would have a typical mass 10<sup>16</sup> times that of the proton, or about 0.00001 milligram. According to the standard big bang theory, monopoles should have emerged very early in the evolution of the universe and should now be as abundant as protons. in that case, the mean density of matter in the universe would be about 15 orders of magnitude greater than its present value, which is about 10<sup>-29</sup> grams per cubic centimeter.</p>

          <p>The feminists of revolutionary France were not the only persons hoping that the current paroxysm of social change would bring about improvement of their state. A most singular category of men, the public executioners, had thought that the advent of a new regime would transform that peculiar disdain in which society held them. For hundreds of years, the post of Master of the High Works in France's major cities was held by men from ten or so dynastic families, members of an abominable elite that had developed as a Consequence of social prejudice: Anyone who had ever been a <i>bourreau</i> could never hope to find another job, nor COUld he aspire to marry any woman not herself the daughter of a colleague. In this way the dreadful dynasties developed. The best known recipients of this peculiar distinction were the Sanson family, who operated in Paris and Versailles from 1688 to 1847; the diary kept by Charles Henri Sanson, executioner of Paris during the Terror, provides details of the deaths of many illustrious victims.</p>
          <p>Several passages in the Sanson diary suggest that professional executioners did not particularly like having to kill women. This chivalrous repugnance later spread through the Court d'Assizes; while women were regularly condemned to death in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in fact they were almost always reprieved. A roughly contemporaneous reluctance to execute women in the United States has been explained by recent American feminists as evidence of women's almost nonexistent social status at that time; to compensate for legal inegality the men who were women's judges, prosecutors, and jurors adopted a "protective" stance, frequently acquitting women who, in modern retrospect, seem guilty. in France the egalitarian practices of earlier centuries were ultimately reinstated, which guillotined five women.</p>
          <p> This temporary preservation of execution as an exclusively male domainâ€”a thing too necessary and revolting to be inflicted on or endured by half the populationâ€”apparently did not strike legislators as being intolerably illogical, or as being rather a back- handed sort of compliment to men. Proper equality would have involved either equal rights and equal punishment for men and women, or else abolition. However, arguments against the death penalty tend rather to develop from general humanitarian principles, and less from the putative equality of women.</p>
          <p> Chivalry, indeed, would seem to have been the nineteenth century's solution to the problems posed to the authorities by "female" executions. But more importantly, chivalry enabled society to observe a version of that logic set forth in 1791 by Olympe de Gouges, a logic echoed later in the United States by Wendell Phillips, who bluntly declared, "You have granted that women may be hung; therefore you must grant that woman may vote." In not executing women, the judiciary body was able to sidestep these irritating formulations: If women did not receive equal punishment under law, perhaps they need not be assured of equal rights.</p>

        <div id="passage3" class="passage">
          <p>Political parties today are consciously non- ideological, but in the 1840s and 1850s ideology made its way into the heart of the political system. Political sociologists have pointed out that the stable functioning of a political democracy requires a setting in which parties represent broad coalitions of varying interests, and that the peaceful resolution of social conflict takes place most easily when the major parties share fundamental values. Such a view implies that the peaceful operation of the political system is the highest social value, an implication which, under certain circumstances, may be justly questioned. But it does contain important insights about the normal functioning of the American polity. Government by majority rule, Carl Becker observed many years ago, works best when political issues involve superficial problems, rather than deep social divisions. The minority can accept the victory of the majority at the polls, because both share many basic values, and electoral defeat does not imply "a fatal surrender of vital interests."</p>
          <p>Before the 1850s, the second American party system conformed to this patternâ€”largely because sectional ideologies and issues were consciously kept out of politics. In this sense, the party system had a certain artificial quality. lts divisions rarely corresponded to the basic sectional divisions which were daily becoming more and more pronounced. The two decades before the Civil War witnessed the development of conflicting sectional ideologies, each viewing its own society as fundamentally well-ordered, and the other as both a negation of its most cherished values and a threat to its existence.</p>
          <p>The development of the two ideologies was in many ways interrelated; each grew in part as a response to the growth of the other. Thus, as southerners were coming more and more consciously to insist on slavery as the very basis of civilized life, and to reject the materialism and lack of cohesion in northern society, northerners came to view slavery as the antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests. The existing political system could not contain these two irreconcilable ideologies, and in the 1850s each national partyâ€”Whigs, Know-Nothings, and finally Democratsâ€”disintegrated. And in the end the South seceded from the Union rather than accept the victory of a political party whose ideology threatened everything Southerners most valued.</p>
          <p> At the center of the Republican ideology was the notion of "free labor." This concept involved not merely an attitude toward work, but a justification of antebellum northern society, and it led northern Republicans to an extensive critique of southern society, which appeared both different from and inferior to their own. Republicans also believed in the existence of a conspiratorial "slave power" which had seized control of the federal government. Two profoundly different and antagonistic civilizations, Republicans thus believed, had developed within the nation, and were competing for control of the political system.</p>

Beware of distractor answers <em>deliberateness</em> and <em>slowness</em>, which reflect the clue without the contrast required by the transition <em>even though.</em></p>

            <p>Because <em>there will always be more to analyze</em>, the <em>critical analysis of the works of Shakespeare</em> must not be complete. Write down “complete” and look to eliminate words that don’t match. <em>Comprehensive</em> and <em>exhaustive</em> both mean “complete,” so choices (C) and (F) are the correct answers. Be sure to write down your own answer first, so as to avoid being tempted by distractor choices such as <em>pedantic</em> and <em>learned;</em> both refer to scholarly endeavors, but neither matches the meaning of the blank that is indicated by the clue.</p>

            <p>The transition <em>while</em> and the juxtaposition of <em>showing leniency</em> and <em>punishing ruthlessly</em> indicate that <em>leniency</em> (mercy) was shown to those who did the opposite of <em>remain defiant</em>, so write down “not defiant” for the blank, and cross off answer choices that don’t match. Both <em>complaisant</em> and <em>obeisant</em> mean submissive (i.e. “not defiant”), so answer choices (B) and (C) are correct. Watch out for the distractor answer <em>bellicose</em> (warlike), which describes foes, but continues the direction of the clue (<em>defiant</em>) instead of changing it (as required by the transition <em>while</em>).</p>

            <p>The clue tells you that whatever Clovis did to paganism, he did it <em>in favor of Christianity</em>, so he must have rejected the former. Look to eliminate words that don’t match “reject” or “give up.” Both <em>legitimize</em> and <em>espouse</em> mean the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate (D) and (E). Neither <em>desiccate</em>, which means to dry out, nor <em>exacerbate</em>, which means to make worse, means “reject” or “give up,” so eliminate choices (A) and (C).
