            <p><strong>B</strong>The text is primarily concerned with showing the ancient origin of modern currency and underlines the touchstone’s importance within this history; therefore, choice (B) is correct. Choice (A) is too broad—the passage is concerned only with currency, not science in general. Conversely, choice (C) is too narrow; the passage talks about the touchstone’s historical importance, not just the science behind it. The passage does not discuss where the word came from, so choice (D) is incorrect. Choice (E) is also wrong because there is no historical misconception that needs to be cleared up.</p>

        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p> It might seem illogical that the development of modern currency rests on a scientific discovery, but the invention of the “touchstone” allowed ancient societies to create a standard by which valuable metals could be judged. In its most basic form, a touchstone is any dark, finely grained stone upon which soft metals leave traces. When rubbed, a process known as “probing,” precious metal alloy cleaves to the stone, leaving a stripe. The color of the stripe (which reveals the percentage of its content that is base metal) can then be compared to a stripe of a known grade of standard alloy. Despite its primitiveness, this probing process allowed merchants to examine alloys quickly and with reasonable certainty. Though civilizations were using gold and silver currencies as early as 500 <span>B.C.</span>, coins were easily forged or diluted with less valuable metals, such as tin or lead. The invention and popularization of the touchstone ensured that pure gold and silver could become a standard expression of value. </p>

 C</strong>Choice (C) accurately describes the reason for including the details concerning the inclusion of lesser metals in early coins: It takes the details of how the touchstone works and shows why the touchstone was important for trade. The passage does not state how individuals previously tested metals, so choice (A) cannot be true. Choice (B) is also incorrect because the date given in the passage is of the earliest use of coins; it does not talk about the date of the touchstone. The purpose of the sentence is not to give a cultural context because the passage does not identify the cultures ­involved, so eliminate choice (D).

            <p><strong>
 Thus, she is a progenitor of Chopin…</strong> A <em>progenitor</em> is a precursor or an ancestor, so the correct sentence tells you that Szymanowska’s techniques and compositions came before and influenced those of Chopin. The other composers mentioned in the passage are either described as her contemporaries or given no chronological relationship to Szymanowska, so none of the other sentences that refer to composers can be supported.</p>

        <div id="passage2" class="passage">
          <p> Women played a substantial role in the furthering of the Polish art song in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. One notable woman from this time period was Maria Szymanowska, who was both a concert pianist and a composer. </p>
          <p> Szymanowska was a member of the Warsaw Music Society who contributed pieces to a cycle entitled Historical Songs. Her songs are by far the most creative and individualistic of the cycle. In addition, Szymanowska composed more than one hundred other pieces, mostly for the piano, including six romances. </p>
          <p> Her songs most resemble French romances, and she also employs Polonaise rhythms in two of her songs. In all her works, the melodic line is technically superior. She employs idiomatic keyboard writing, wide chord-spacing, broad cantilenas, and interesting modulations. She also uses the most compelling registers of the instrument and pianistic keys. Her romances are on par with those of Beethoven, Schubert, and Mozart. In fact, Szymanowska was praised by her contemporaries, such as Schumann, who lauded her etudes. Her piano playing was frequently equated to that of Hummel, though Szymanowska’s was said to be more ethereal. Thus, she is a progenitor of Chopin in both piano technique and composition. </p>
          <p> Female contributors to the development of Polish music have been chiefly ignored. From the meager records which have been preserved, it is incontrovertible that Polish women were, in fact, playing, instructing, and writing music as early as the fifteenth century. However, patriarchal societal structures have precluded adequate documentation about, and preservation of, their work. Unless changes take place, human society will be made poorer for its inability to recognize the expertise and inventiveness of these women. </p>

 B</strong>The author states <em>human society will be poorer for its inability to recognize the expertise and inventiveness of these women.</em> The author states this as a blunt fact: Choice (B), <em>emphatic,</em> is closest to this, as the author states, with emphasis, his opinion. The author does not wish for the past to return, so choice (A), <em>nostalgic,</em> is incorrect. The author is not <em>dismissive</em> of the musicians, but rather dislikes the fact that others have dismissed the musicians, so choice (C) is incorrect.

Choice (B) is supported: All her pieces have <em>technically superior</em> elements, but only two are specified to have <em>Polonaise rhythms</em> Choice (C) is not supported: The passage never specifies which of her over one hundred works were most highly praised, and more specific information is needed before a judgment of <em>disproportionate amount of attention</em> can be justified.</p>

Choices (A), (D), and (F) all have the opposite meaning and <em>proliferation</em> and <em>burgeoning</em> are not really words that could be used to describe <em>run-off</em> either. <em>Paucity</em> and <em>dearth</em> both indicate that something is lacking and are the correct choices.</p>

 A</strong> and <strong>E</strong></p>
            <p>The girl <em>could always find something else that displeased her</em> which means that she must be a <em>habitual</em> complainer. She may be an <em>impertinent</em> complainer, but there is no evidence that she was rude in the way she complained. The same problem exists with choices (C) and (F). <em>Oblique</em>, which means <em>not straightforward,</em> does not make sense in context, which rules out choice (D). <em>Inveterate</em> and <em>chronic</em> are synonyms for <em>habitual</em>, so choices (A) and (E) are correct.</p>

            <p>The different-direction trigger word to focus on here is instead, which tells you that the type of person she is should be different from one who has a secret. <em>Inscrutable</em> is similar in meaning to <em>an enigma behind the celebrated smile</em>, so choice (E) is incorrect. Lisa del Giocondo may well have been <em>dulcet</em> or <em>comely</em>, but there is no supporting evidence for these words in the sentence. Since we are looking for a word that refers to someone who doesn’t keep secrets, choices (B) <em>guileless</em> and (F) <em>ingenuous</em> are the best answers.</p>

            <p><em>Hyperbolic</em> means <em>exaggerated</em> The correct answers will be words that mean something a bit more extreme than <em>quaint</em> that also contrast with the imposition of mining equipment. <em>Germane</em> means <em>relevant to</em>, and doesn’t fit here; eliminate choice (A). <em>Gentrified</em> refers to an area that was previously owned or occupied by poor people and is transformed by more wealthy people. Although it is relevant to the subject, it is a trap that doesn’t fit with the rest of the sentence, so choice (B) should be eliminated. <em>Aplomb</em> (self-confidence) and <em>rancorous</em> (greatly hostile) are similarly irrelevant to this question, so eliminate choices (C) and (E). <em>Bucolic</em> means <em>idyllically pastoral</em> or <em>rural,</em> and <em>quiescent</em> means <em>quiet</em> or <em>restful.</em> Plugging either into the blank produces a sentence that is congruent, making choices (D) and (F) the best answers.</p>
