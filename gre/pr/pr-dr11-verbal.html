            <p><strong>It is, however, impossible to know whether this difference is due to…</strong> The critics, mentioned in the first paragraph, fear <em>deleterious rather than beneficial effects…on the academic achievement of students</em> The second paragraph discusses academic outcomes of charter schools, so that is where you should look for the answer. The first two sentences of the paragraph discuss the amount of impact charter schools have had, but do not make specific mention of bad effects. The third sentence provides factual evidence for the critics, but does not give the author’s opinion regarding this evidence. The final sentence of this paragraph is correct because in it, the author questions whether simply being a charter school is the reason that some schools do not meet state standards.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="passage1" class="passage">
          <p> It has frequently been argued that freeing schools from the rigid rules, regulations, and statutes that have traditionally fettered them would have a revolutionary effect on academic achievement. For instance, it has been suggested that schools embodying this idea could develop more effective teaching methods that could then be replicated in other schools. Charter schools—public schools that operate under a contract, or “charter”—were given just such an opportunity beginning in 1991, when Minnesota passed the first charter school law. At that time, many critics warned of deleterious rather than beneficial effects that such freewheeling schools could have on the academic achievement of students. Thus, while public opinion differed concerning the social desirability of charter schools, most agreed that there would be a pronounced effect. </p>
          <p> Surprisingly, educators who study educational reform now seriously question the degree to which charter schools have made an impact. They conclude that freedom from many of the policies and regulations affecting traditional public schools and the concomitant control over decisions that guide the day-to-day affairs of the school have not resulted in equally dramatic changes in students’ academic performance. In some states, charter schools are less likely to meet state performance standards than traditional public schools. It is, however, impossible to know whether this difference is due to the performance of the schools, the prior achievement of the students, or some other factor. </p>
          <p> Metrics for educational accountability have changed considerably in the past decade, moving increasingly to performance as measured by state mandated tests of individual student achievement. Fundamentally, however, the challenging conditions under which schools operate, be they traditional or charter, have changed little: the struggle for resources, low pay for teachers, accountability to multiple stakeholders, and the difficulty of meeting the educational requirements of children with special needs all persist. </p>

While the study of memory is important, there’s no evidence that it’s <em>the most important approach</em> No other approach is mentioned in the text. Choice (B) works well because the text tells you Proust is “widely recognized as an icon of French culture and literature” and that “many commentaries have focused on Proust’s treatment of…memory.” Choice (C) can be eliminated because the second half of the answer cannot be supported.

        <div id="passage2" class="passage">
          <p> Many scholars consider Marcel Proust’s <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em> (1913–1927) a significant literary achievement. For instance, Harold Bloom states that it is “widely recognized as the major novel of the twentieth century.” In addition to noting its length—it spans seven volumes and 3,200 pages—many commentaries have focused on Proust’s treatment of two kinds of memory, involuntary and voluntary. Involuntary memory occurs through the stimulation of the senses, while voluntary memory is a deliberate effort to remember the past. For Proust, involuntary memories are superior because they contain the spirit of the past in a way that voluntary memories do not; the former are more vivid, and they have the power to erase the temporal distance between the present moment and past experiences. More recently, scholars such as André Benhaïm have explored the relationship between Proust’s treatment of memory and his representation of France and French culture. According to Benhaïm, memory functions within this text to reconfigure both. </p>
          <p> Proust describes France in ways that one would not expect. In his work, French cities are archaic and exotic. As a result, the narrator becomes a stranger to, or is estranged from, his homeland, and lives the life of an exile. For instance, when recalling his travels through the fictional French town of Balbec, he states, “These strangely ordinary and disdainfully familiar cathedrals cruelly stunned my unconsidered eyes and stabbed my homesick heart.” Words such as “stun” and “stab” suggest the hostility the narrator feels from this French territory. Proust’s suggestion of Middle Eastern influences further distorts the idea of a singular French experience. First, the town’s name refers to the ancient city of Baalbek, located in what is now Lebanon. Second, Balbec is populated by Jewish residents. Proust is widely recognized as an icon of French literature and culture, but ultimately his mysterious representations of this place and its culture call into question the existence of a single Francophone literature or a single French identity. </p>

 B</strong>The second paragraph focuses on Benhaïm’s study of Proust’s text. Because of Proust’s mysterious and, at times, hostile representations of French cities, the narrator is turned into an exile in his homeland. The quotation illustrates this point using the narrator’s perception of Balbec, which for him is strange and cruel. Choice (B) is the best match. Eliminate choice (A) because it uses information from the passage but doesn’t answer the question. Eliminate choice (C) because the author never discusses the realities of living in France.

            <p>The clue in this sentence is <em>filled the air with tension</em> Both <em>ambience</em> and <em>atmosphere</em> refer to the environment of a place or situation. All of the wrong answer choices are words that may be associated with a gala, but they do not fit this clue. Choice (B) may seem close, but the rest of the sentence does not tell you what the party-goers were discussing. Choice (E) may also seem like a good fit, but again, the sentence does not tell you how people were acting. Choice (A) would refer to decorations and choice (F) would refer to an activity.</p>

            <p>The sentence suggests that it is <em>unfair</em> to tax the middle class unless the upper class is taxed as well. <em>Sporadic</em> means <em>occurring at random times</em>, <em>subtle</em> means <em>barely noticeable</em>, <em>dignified</em> means <em>expressing worthiness or honor</em>, and <em>pardonable</em> means <em>forgivable</em> None of these fit the idea of <em>unfair</em> Choices (A) and (C) come closest to <em>unfair</em> or <em>unable to be justified</em></p>

            <p><strong>A</strong> and <strong>F</strong></p>
            <p>Since ghosts are described as <em>unseen by the majority</em>, it must be difficult to provide <em>visible</em> or <em>definite</em> proof. <em>Indisputable</em> and <em>demonstrable</em> both convey the meaning you want, and produce equivalent, appropriate sentences. Choice (D) means <em>important</em> Choice (B) means <em>intimidating</em> and choice (C) means <em>mysterious</em><em>Skeptical</em> may be a good word to describe those who don’t see the ghosts, but it can’t describe the proof.</p>

            <p>The sentence tells us that the politician claimed that he did not seek to enrich himself. However, the trigger word <em>but</em> indicates that the blank will have the opposite meaning: He did attempt to enrich himself. Choices (B) and (D) work in this context. Choices (A) and (E) go in the wrong direction, as they describe what the politician claimed, and choices (C) and (F) have no relationship to the blank.</p>

            <p>The clues to the blank are that it was once unspoiled before the <em>calamitous</em> event, which indicates that it is now <em>damaged</em>, the word you are looking for. Choices (A) and (F) can be used to describe physical destruction and are the best answers. Choices (C), (D), and (E), may refer to the people who live near the seascape, but the blank is only about the seascape and there are no clues about its inhabitants.

            <p>Someone worried about having to analyze an <em>esoteric</em> poem would be <em>delighted</em> to get one that was clear or easily understood, so something like <em>clarity</em> would make sense in the blank. Both <em>ambiguity</em> and <em>opacity</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (B) and (F). Neither <em>cadency</em>, which means <em>rhythm,</em> nor <em>melancholy</em>, which means <em>sadness,</em> is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (A) and (D).
