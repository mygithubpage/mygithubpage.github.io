            <p><strong> A</strong> The missing word refers to a <em>project—</em>in this case a screenwriter’s story—which consists of <em>little more than a few basic plot points</em>. Therefore, the missing word might mean something like <em>incomplete</em>, so you can immediately eliminate choice (B). There is not enough information to suggest that the story is <em>convoluted</em>, <em>prosaic</em>, or <em>tortuous</em>, so eliminate choices (C), (D), and (E). <em>Undeveloped</em> means <em>incomplete</em>, so choice (A) is the best answer.</p>

The northern nations could easily overpower the southern nations, and so they had an <em>upper hand</em>. <em>Advantage</em> is the only choice that means <em>upper hand</em> and is correct.</p>

            <p>For the first blank, the sentence states that prisons are <em>less</em> something than <em>musing on ethics</em>. Thus, while a word like <em>theoretical</em> would make sense, <em>esoteric</em> is the best match. The second blank describes the view you would have from the center; <em>panoramic</em> makes the most sense. Finally, the third blank is contrasting with when the guards are looking <em>elsewhere</em>, thus <em>scrutinized</em> is the best match.</p>

            <p><strong> dependent on, repudiated,</strong> and <strong>specious</strong></p>
            <p>Start with the last blank because it is the easiest. The clue tells you that <em>the plaintiff’s case disintegrated</em>. Therefore, the claims must have been shown to be false. <em>Facetious</em>, though somewhat negative, does not mean <em>false</em> but does not go far enough. <em>Unerring</em> goes in the opposite direction. <em>Specious</em> is the best match. The first blank is the easiest one to attempt next. The case fell apart when something happened to the witnesses’ credentials, so a good phrase for the first blank—which described the role of the witnesses in the plaintiff’s case—is “based on.” <em>Dependent on</em> is the only match. If the plaintiff’s claims were based on the witnesses, and the case fell apart, logically the witnesses must have been discredited somehow. A good word for the second blank—which describes what the court decided about the witnesses’ credentials—is <em>denied</em>. <em>Vindicated</em> goes in the opposite direction. <em>Repudiated</em> is the best match.</p>

            <p><strong> D</strong> The blank refers to Emmet Ray’s <em>paradoxical</em> character.

Look for a word that means unsophisticated, and use POE to eliminate choices (B) and (E)<em>.

Of the choices, only <em>impugn</em> means attack. The second blank refers to <em>claims made against</em> the group that the editorial was trying to support; the actions were inadvertent, so a good word for the blank might be something like <em>supported</em> or <em>proved</em>.

The second blank needs to be consistent with the clue <em>desire for company</em>. <em>Collaborative</em> means enjoys working with others but not a <em>desire for company</em>, but a <em>gregarious</em> creature is <em>quite social</em> and seeks out company. <em>Egregious</em> means <em>extremely bad</em>, and does not match. The third blank must also describe something like <em>company</em>. <em>Litheness</em> means <em>grace and flexibility</em> and <em>fatuity</em> means <em>idiotic</em>, and neither one truly refers to having company. <em>Camaraderie</em> means <em>trusting friendship</em>, which is the most like <em>company</em> and makes it the best answer.</p>

Someone who does this would be snobbish, so the first blank must mean something like <em>snobbishness</em>. <em>Puerility</em> means <em>immaturity</em> and <em>substantiation</em> means <em>proof</em>, so neither of those is a match, while <em>haughtiness</em> does mean <em>snobbishness</em>. If the <em>advanced degrees are not a license</em>, that means that they do not give someone permission to do something bad such as have arrogance or egotism. The second blank must mean something like <em>permit</em>. To <em>dispel</em> is to <em>push away</em>, which is almost the opposite of what you need here.

An <em>incantation</em> is a <em>magical spell</em> and <em>relish</em> could mean <em>enjoyment</em>, but neither word pertains to being scholarly. An <em>exegesis</em> is a <em>critical explanation</em>, or <em>scholarly study</em>, and is correct. Bettelheim’s focus is <em>severely constricted by his narrow worldview</em>, so it must be <em>narrow</em>. <em>Sweeping</em> can mean <em>vast</em>, the opposite of what you need.

            <p>The bill pushed through by the foreign government was touted as increasing transparency, professional integrity, and independence for the media; in reality, though, the bill was simply a way for the officials to protect their cronyism from the newspapers that had been _______ in their attempts to expose government corruption.</p>

            <p><strong>      A</strong> and <strong>F</strong></p>
            <p>The blank describes the newspapers’ <em>attempts to expose government corruption</em>; since the sentence suggests that the threat posed by the papers inspired the new law, a word that means something like <em>effective</em>, <em>thorough</em>, or <em>hard-working</em> would make sense. Both <em>lackadaisical</em> and <em>perfunctory</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (B) and (C). Choices (D) and (E) give roughly synonymous meanings, but aren’t supported by the sentence. Both <em>assiduous</em> and <em>sedulous</em> can mean <em>hard-working,</em> so choices (A) and (F) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

            <p>The clue word <em>sartorial</em> means <em>relating to tailoring or clothing</em>, so the word in the blank must mean <em>clothing</em>. <em>Panegyric</em> and <em>oratory</em> both mean <em>speech</em>, so eliminate choices (A) and (E). <em>Raiment</em> and <em>caparison</em> both mean <em>clothing</em>, making choices (B) and (D) correct. <em>Fetes</em> and <em>soirees</em> are both types of <em>parties</em>, so eliminate choices (C) and (E).</p>

            <p>Marian does not comment on her grandmother’s hat out of respect, which means she dislikes the hat. You need a word that means <em>ugly or in poor taste</em>. <em>Iconoclastic</em> and <em>heretical</em> both mean <em>going against established beliefs</em>. This is too strong and does not describe a hat, so eliminate choices (A) and (F). <em>Imperious</em> and <em>haughty</em> both mean <em>arrogant</em>, so eliminate choices (B) and (C). <em>Gaudy</em> and <em>garish</em> both mean <em>showy and in poor taste</em>, and can be used to describe clothing. Choices (D) and (E) are both correct.</p>

            <p>The other students did not to sit at Fred’s table because they did not like the remarks he made. The word in the blank must be negative. <em>Puerile</em> and <em>jejune</em> both mean <em>childish and immature</em>, so choices (A) and (E) are correct. <em>Crude</em> means <em>lacking tact,</em> which fits but there is no synonym for <em>crude</em> among the options; eliminate choice (B). <em>Limpid</em> is positive and means <em>clear</em>, so eliminate choice (C). <em>Inimical</em> means <em>hostile</em> and <em>insidious</em> means <em>stealthy or treacherous</em>, but neither word has a synonym among the options.
