            <p>Veeder thinks something about synonyms, words that mean the same thing. Meaning for him seems to depend upon context and connotation as much as an actual dictionary definition, which would make the notion of synonyms difficult since there would always be external circumstances to consider. Therefore, we need something negative for the first blank at least. That knocks out <em>veracious</em><em>Maladaptive</em> doesn’t make sense since nothing is adapting, so <em>fallacious</em> must work. For the second blank we need things that contribute to the meanings of words. Only <em>denotation</em> works. And for the last blank, we need something that says that even synonyms are different. <em>Distinct</em> fits the bill.</p>

The clue after the colon refers to a negative consequence of the politicians’ actions, so the second blank must be a negative word. <em>Apt</em> means <em>smart</em> and is a positive word you can eliminate. <em>Injudicious</em> and <em>jejune</em> are both negative words. <em>Injudicious</em> means <em>unwise</em> and <em>ostentatious</em> means <em>pretentiously showy</em><em>Injudicious</em> is a better fit for the blank: The problem with the politicians emphasizing their own virtues is that it is <em>ineffective and ill-advised</em></p>

 A</strong>Eliminate choice (B); while the author compares the Judeo-Christian concept of god with the Nahuas’ belief in the sacred power of <em>teotl,</em> the author never discusses any Christian stories that ­explain the beginnings of the world. <em>Teotl</em> is not a concept in Western philosophy, so eliminate choice (C). Though the author’s definition of <em>teotl</em> makes a comparison, one isn’t supported over the other, eliminating choice (D).

          <p> According to scholars, the indigenous peoples of ancient Mesoamerica, specifically the Nahuas, developed a rich and complex philosophy comprising four interrelated and overlapping branches of knowledge: metaphysics, epistemology, theory of value, and aesthetics. At the core of their philosophy was <em>teotl</em>, which, rather than an immutable supernatural being like the Judaeo-Christian deity, was an ever-moving and ever-changing, self-producing sacred power that animated the universe and its contents. It was responsible for all things in nature—animals, rocks, rain, and so on—and permeated the details of everything. There was no distinction between teotl and the natural world; teotl was in every entity, and every entity was also teotl. Unlike Western philosophy, which fosters dichotomies such as the personal versus the impersonal, that of the Nahuas posited a sacred power that was united with everything; it was both intrinsic and transcendent. </p>

Choice (A), however, is phrased in too extreme a form to be supported by the passage; additionally, the final sentence says that <em>scent, vocalization, and aggressive displays</em> also mark territory.

          <p> The wombat is a muscular quadruped, about 3 feet in length with a short tail. The animal, which is not a mythical creature but an Australian marsupial, has a name derived from the language of the native peoples of the Sydney area, the Eora aboriginals. Wombats are herbivores and leave cubic scats that are easily recognized. Because wombats are seldom seen, attributed to the fact that they are nocturnal, the scats provide crucial evidence regarding territory. This large, burrowing mammal is not related to the badger, whose habits are similar. In fact, the koala is the wombat’s closest relative. The principal burrowing instrument of the latter is its incisors which, like those of other rodents with orange enamel, are never worn down. Burrows can be extensive and shared by more than one wombat, despite the generally solitary nature of the creature. Territories within the burrow are marked by scent, vocalizations, and aggressive displays. </p>

Choices (B) and (D) give equivalent meanings as well, but lasting effects are what Tess is trying to avoid. Both <em>nominal</em> and <em>negligible</em> can mean small, so choices (C) and (E) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>
