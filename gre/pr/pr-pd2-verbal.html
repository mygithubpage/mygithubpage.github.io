None of the choices match “unsupported conclusions,” but (E) and (F) can be eliminated because they indicate ill-intent and submission, neither of which can be used to match “unsupported conclusions.” Choice (D), <em>brazenness</em>, can match “unsupported conclusions,” since the <em>researcher’s conclusions</em> contradicted <em>established knowledge</em>, so the correct answer for the second blank is (D), <em>brazenness</em> Now look at the third blank, which refers to something the <em>researcher</em> would be <em>due</em> The clue for the third blank is <em>forgo recognition</em> The transition words <em>for the time being</em> and <em>once</em> indicate the word for the blank will match the clue, so recycle “recognition” as a word for the third blank. Choice (I), <em>diligence</em>, can be eliminated because it doesn’t match “recognition.” While <em>compensation</em> can be a form of “recognition,” it does not directly mean recognition, so eliminate (G), and the correct answer for the third blank is (H), <em>kudos</em> Now look at the first blank, which refers to how the <em>young researcher…stated her findings</em> As the researcher wanted to avoid accusations of unsupported conclusions, and was not seeking recognition, use “humbly” as a word for the first blank.

          <p>ln Angloâ€”American formalism, surrealism was considered a deviant art movement: improperly visual and impertinently literary, relatively in attentive to the imperatives of form, and mostly indifferent to the laws of genre, a paradoxical avant-garde concerned with infantile states and outmoded forms, not properly modernist at all. For neoâ€”avant-garde artists who challenged this hegemony three decades ago, its very deviance might have made surrealism an attractive object. But such was not the case. Since this formalist model of modernism was staked on the autonomy of modern art as separate from social practice and grounded in visual experience, its antagonist, the neoâ€”avant-garde account of modernism, stressed the two movements, dada and constructivism, that appeared most opposed to this visualist autonomyâ€”that sought to destroy the separate institution of art in an anarchic attack on its formal conventions, as did dada, or to transform it according to the materialist practices of a revolutionary society, as did constructivism. Again surrealism was lost in the shuffle. To the neoâ€”avant-gardists who challenged the formalist account in the 1950s and 1960s, it too appeared corrupt: technically kitschy, philosophically subjective, hypocritically elitist. Hence when artists involved in pop and minimalism turned away from the likes of Picasso and Matisse, they turned to such figures as Duchamp and Rodchenko, not to precedents like Ernst and Giacometti.</p>

Eliminate (C), as the passage provides no such comparison between the degree to which Forster versus other modern writers are equally novelists of ideas.

          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="passage2" class="passage">
          <p>E. M. Forster is an Edwardian in point of time, and he is equally so in spirit. His outlook on the world and his literary manner were already thoroughly developed in that epoch and have passed through the subsequent years of turbulence and cataclysm with remarkably little modification. The various modern revolutions in physics, in psychology, in politics, even in literary style, have not escaped his intelligent notice, but they can scarcely be said to have influenced him deeply. His response to the explosion of the Victorian dream of benevolent progress has been a modest and orderly retreat to safer groundâ€”to a tolerant individualism now unmixed with Utopian dreams, but nevertheless closer to Victorian ideals than to any of the popular creeds of today. Rather than conform to bad times, Forster prefers to remind us cheerfully that his views are atavistic.</p>
          <p>The strength of Forster's resistance to the twentieth century is especially apparent when we place him beside some of his fellow writers. If Joyce, Lawrence, Pound, and the early Eliot represent the main current of the modern literary movement in English, we must admit that Forster's private stream runs in an older channel. These others were radical iconoclasts whose rejection of bourgeoisâ€”democratic life was violent and shattering. Equally shattering was their fragmentation of the polite cadences of Victorian literature. In seeing the falseness of the old psychology, they conceived a scorn for the <i>hypocrite lecteur</i>; their role as apocalyptic prophets, as naysayers to the boredom and specious rationality of modern life, demanded that they be obscure and idiosyncratic. Forster, in contrast, unashamedly calls himself a bourgeois and remains faithful to the tradition of calm intelligibility. He is anti-apocalyptic in both his politics and his literary sense. To some degree his novels return us to the congenial Victorian relationship between writer and reader, with its unspoken agreement over the usefulness of the sociable virtues and its apotheosis of the happy family. Though Forster's heroes struggle against "society" as a body of inhibitions, their revolt is never truly radical. And Forster's ironical style, though it is unsparing in its probing at shams and half-truths, presupposes a confidence in the reader's sympathy and good judgmentâ€”a confidence that seemed quite archaic to the other writers named.</p>
          <p>Forster's resistance to modernity may account for the fact that his novels, though they are almost universally esteemed, have never won him a cult of fanatical disciples. With a few exceptions, critics have tended to explicate and admire his works without becoming heated over the possible merit of his ideas. Yet Forster decidedly <b><i>is</i></b> a novelist of ideas, and didactic moral content is hardly less conspicuous in his work than in Lawrence's. Forster's persistent "moral" is that the life of affectionate personal relations, disengaged from political and religious zeal by means of a tolerant eclecticism, is supremely valuable. This is not a stirring creed; in fact, it is a warning against allowing oneself to be stirred by any creed.</p>

              </span>The support for the answer to this purpose question is provided by the statement in the passage that Forster’s beliefs are “closer to Victorian ideals than to any of the popular creeds of today.” Choice (A) is recycled language as “individualism” is used to describe Forster, not to describe something important to Forster’s work. Choice (B) can be eliminated, because “isolate” and “unconnected” are extreme language that is not supported by the text, which states that “modern revolutions…have not escaped his intelligent notice.” Choice (D) can be eliminated, because “ardent supporter” is extreme language that is not supported by the text, which claims that Forster’s beliefs are in line with Edwardian ideals, but makes no statement about Forster’s political actions. Choice (E) can be eliminated, because inherent belief in Victorianism is extreme language that is not supported by the text, which states that Forster’s beliefs are “now unmixed with Utopian dreams,” and differ from Victorianism. The correct answer is (C).</p>

            <p>This select the sentence question references a sentence that proposes an explanation for the lack of passion among some readers for the ideas put forth by Forster. This subject refers to the statement in the passage that Forster’s “novels…have never won him a cult of fanatical disciples” due to “Forster’s resistance to modernity.” While the next sentence continues to discuss reactions to Forster, it provides no explanation. The correct answer is the first sentence of the third paragraph.</p>
