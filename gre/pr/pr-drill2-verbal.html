            <p>The sentence starts with the trigger word <em>Despite</em> to set up a contrast between the two parts of the sentence. Since the first part describes her poor physical condition and the second her <em>surprisingly</em> positive state, the first blank has to describe her arthritis in a negative way. <em>Mildly</em> and <em>sympathetically</em> would not present the arthritis negatively, so the best answer is <em>chronically</em>. Similarly, the clue to the second blank is <em>pleasant</em> and it implies that the dog is positively described. <em>Enervated</em> means <em>lacking energy</em>, and <em>acute</em> could means <em>perceptive</em>, which also does not make sense here. Thus the best answers are <em>chronically</em> and <em>agile</em>.</p>

            <p>Start with the third blank: You need something that can be yelled, and can’t be stopped with handcuffs, so a word like <em>insults</em> would make sense in the blank. Of the choices, only <em>epithets</em> means insults. The second blank should contrast with the third blank, and describe the type of violence that can be stopped with handcuffs. Hence, you need a word like <em>physical</em>; of the choices, <em>corporeal</em> is the best fit. Finally, the first blank should mean something like <em>fighting,</em> since you know the two men are <em>handcuffed</em> and have been engaging in <em>physical violence</em>. <em>Belligerent</em> is the best choice.</p>

            <p>The sentence starts with the trigger word <em>Though</em>, signaling that the two parts of the sentence will be different. Since you know the town is <em>scenically beautiful</em>, the second blank means something else besides its appearance. Eliminate <em>attractive</em>, and eliminate <em>picaresque</em> because there is no clue that the town refers to an <em>adventure story</em>. <em>Cultural</em> makes the most sense for the meaning of the second blank. The first blank describes the <em>scenically beautiful town</em>, and must mean something similar to <em>attractive country</em> as a contrast to the city. Eliminate <em>sprawling</em> and <em>desolate</em>, neither of which are suggested by the clues. <em>Bucolic</em>, which means <em>pertaining to country pleasantness</em>, is the strongest fit. The best answers are <em>bucolic</em> and <em>cultural</em>.</p>

For the second blank, you need something like <em>making worse</em>, because you know that the people are even angrier; <em>exacerbating</em> is the best fit.

For the first blank, the clue is that the memoir allows <em>distinguished figures</em> to tell us about <em>experiences and wisdom learned</em>, so the missing word must mean <em>write about</em>. <em>Extemporize</em> means <em>to improvise</em>, which is incorrect because Grant wrote an actual account, and <em>exagitate</em> is incorrect because there is no suggestion of his <em>stirring up or censuring</em>. <em>Expatiate</em>, which means <em>to write about in detail</em>, is the best fit. For the second blank, note the contrast between <em>the significant works of distinguished figures</em> and <em>the experience of a fly-by-night internet celebrity</em>. The missing word will mean <em>insignificant</em>. <em>Apocryphal</em> is incorrect because the writings are not necessarily <em>fictional</em>, and <em>eccentric</em> is incorrect because there’s no context to support the experiences being <em>unusual</em>.

Neither <em>decorum</em> nor <em>ennui</em> means <em>honor</em>, but <em>esteem</em> does. For the second blank, the semicolon trigger indicates than an explanation will be given about how Father’s Day became <em>an honored tradition</em>. Ask yourself what was <em>required</em> from <em>prominent figures</em> before Americans <em>embraced the holiday</em>. The second blank must mean something like praise.

That makes <em>inerrancy</em> the best answer for the first blank. For the second blank, the trigger word <em>However</em> signals a different interpretation of the same <em>belief</em>, the meaning of the missing word. <em>Erudition</em>, or <em>scholarly knowledge</em>, can be eliminated, and <em>centurion</em> is irrelevant to the clues and blank.

For the first blank, look for things that go with <em>arrogant</em> and <em>bitterly critical</em>. Only <em>bellicose,</em> meaning <em>aggressive and hostile,</em> is sufficiently negative. The second blank describes the actions of the guy, so we need something along the same lines. Although <em>eulogies</em>belong at funerals, we need something bad. <em>Diatribes</em> work.

          <p> Historically, sociologists have presumed that people will attribute certain characteristics to a member of a particular group when it is generally believed that most members of that group possess the characteristics in question. For sociologists Hepburn and Locksley, such social stereotyping has led to the broader question of whether people are cognizant of their own stereotyping behavior. Seemingly, if one knows that one holds a stereotypical notion such as “all members of a certain ethnic group are natural musicians,” then one might also be aware that the notion that “a particular musician of that ethnic group is a great musician” is a corollary of that stereotype. However, people are most aware of their stereotyping when they have no information. When given information that conforms to their beliefs and the individual case observed, people become less aware of their tendency to stereotype and therefore more likely to engage in stereotyping. </p>

          <p> The literature of the American West ranges from lowbrow entertainment to great works of fiction. The extremes are obvious enough, but the middle tends to blur. The dime-store Western never aspired to be anything but entertainment. James Fenimore Cooper and Willa Cather, however, used themes of westward expansion in works clearly intended as highbrow literature. The novels of modern writer Larry McMurtry broke new ground: He took the Western and created a great piece of fiction, without changing its fundamental genre appeal or its accessibility to the general reader. </p>
          <p> As an example of his retooling of the Western genre, consider McMurtry’s themes. While the Western myth is fundamentally about resettlement to new lands, McMurtry’s novels combine elements of the Western myth with less traditional motifs: profound reluctance to face change, conflict between urbanization and the Western ideal, the importance of place, and the role of the land itself. While the traditional Western is rooted in the past, McMurtry’s themes combine nostalgia for that past with a sense of emptiness in the present and hopelessness for the future. </p>
          <p> Or consider McMurtry’s treatment of character. The traditional Western formula depicts mainly masculine characters and portrays them as both heroic and human. In his novels, McMurtry creates strong female characters, transmuting the conventional plot of the trials and dangers of the frontier by folding in deeper ideological insights. Critics rightly credit his novels with reshaping the Western genre, praising his work and its meticulous attention to the Western <em>mise en scène</em> as a subversive but sincere tribute to the American West. </p>

          <p> “Hydrothermal vent” is the term that scientists use to describe a crack in a planet’s surface from which geothermally heated water emerges. Because these vents are common in places that are volcanically active, they are plentiful on Earth. While the most famous hydrothermal vent is probably the geyser at Yellowstone National Park in the United States, there are several different types of vents, existing both on land and underwater. Black Smokers, for instance, are a common type of submarine vent. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration first discovered these in the vicinity of the Galapagos Islands in 1977. Underwater vents such as these form when water that has been heated by magma beneath the earth’s crust exits through cracks in the ocean floor. Scientists are interested in these vents primarily for their ability to host biologically dense communities in areas that are otherwise hostile to life. Studies show that Chemosynthetic archaea, a life form similar to bacteria, allows these areas to support such diverse organisms as clams and shrimp. Black Smokers are also visually striking. Minerals in the water that emerge from the earth’s crust crystallize around each vent to create their distinctive black chimney-like formations. </p>
          <p> While on a vessel exploring the Atlantis Massif in the mid-Atlantic Ridge, scientists recently discovered a completely new kind of hydrothermal system, which they dubbed “Lost City.” Here, a “forest” of white limestone pillars rises 180 feet above the sea floor. There are several important differences that distinguish the hydrothermal vents in Lost City from the more familiar Black Smokers. The heat and fluid flow at Lost City is driven by the intermingling of seawater and mantle rocks on the sea floor, rather than by hot magma. As these fluids mix with magnesium-rich sea water, they deposit calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide, thereby creating the stunning white structures of Lost City. The fluids here are also much cooler (less than 100 degrees Celsius) and are composed of substances and gases that are different from those of Black Smokers. For instance, the fluids here have high pH content and contain significant amounts of hydrogen and methane gas. </p>
          <p> The discovery of Lost City is still a fairly recent one, and scientists currently have more questions than answers. However, they hope that the insights they gain from this study will provide information that will lead to a better understanding of some of the earliest hydrothermal systems on earth and the life they supported. </p>

          <p> The paintings of Eugene Delacroix are as political, complex, tumultuous, and vivid as the life of Lord Byron, who inspired some of Delacroix’s best works, such as <em>Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi</em> and <em>Scènes des massacres de Scio</em>. Simultaneously, the paintings boast an incredible mélange of the artistic traditions of prior masters and movements—such as a preoccupation with <em>terribilitas</em> from Michelangelo; a flair for color from Titian; and power, strength, and exuberance from Rubens—all underlain by the harmony and balance of classical artists and tinted with the Baroque. Delacroix combined eclectic elements and infused them with his own genius, creating a unique expression of Romanticism, and in so doing, inspired yet another style, Symbolism. </p>

          <p> Sociobiologists, the most well known of whom is Edward O. Wilson, contend that there is a biological basis for the social behavior of animals, and they test their hypotheses through observation of animals in situations. Species studied have varied as widely as to encompass both termites and rhesus macaques. Socio-biologists further argue that students of human behavior cannot adequately account for the panoply of human nature through only such traditional variables as culture, ethnicity, and environment but must also include evolutionary processes. However, many scientists, notably Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, have criticized this approach to the study of humans on a number of grounds: for example, that it is based on Eurocentric notions and that it is plagued by methodological problems. These detractors label it a pseudo-science because sociobiological theories are not falsifiable and thus, in this respect, are similar to alchemy or astrology. </p>

            <p>The clue is that <em>the criminal carried out heinous acts</em>, so the blank describing the criminal must be something like <em>evil</em>. Both <em>enormity</em> and <em>iniquity</em> can mean evil, so choices (B) and (D) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences. Choices (C) and (E) give equivalent meanings, but the sentence doesn’t support the characterization of the criminal as clever. Neither <em>pulchritude</em>, which means beauty, nor <em>perfidy</em>, which means disloyalty, makes sense in the blank, so eliminate choices (A) and (F).</p>

            <p>You know from the clue that <em>human sacrifices were ubiquitous</em>, so the act was familiar to all the tribes. The text sets up a contrast between the <em>Mayans</em> and the <em>neighboring tribes</em> in terms of their sacrificing. The trigger word <em>while</em> signals that the missing word goes in the opposite direction of the clue, and it must mean making the other tribes <em>uncomfortable</em>. Eliminate choices (B) and (E) because those words are positive. Choice (D), <em>expatiated</em>, means <em>speak about in detail</em> and has nothing to do with the context of the sentence. Despite its topical relevance, choice (A) doesn’t contrast with the ubiquity of the sacrifices, nor does the context support the Mayans confining all the other tribes. Although choices (C) and (F) aren’t synonyms, they both fit with the given context to appropriately complete the sentence.</p>

            <p>The trigger <em>in contrast to</em> indicates that the <em>colorful</em> depictions of castles differ from <em>the stark facades of their surviving ruins</em>, so you need a word like <em>decorated</em> for the blank. Both <em>bedizened</em> and <em>caparisoned</em> can mean <em>decorated,</em> so choices (C) and (D) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences. Choices (A) and (B) would also give equivalent meanings, but nothing in the sentence suggests the castles were <em>weakened</em>. Neither <em>extirpated</em>, which means exterminated, nor <em>fomented</em>, which means incited, makes sense in the sentence, so eliminate choices (E) and (F).</p>

            <p>Recycle the clue <em>sanctimonious and self-righteous</em> into the blank. Both <em>ingenuous</em> and <em>unaffected</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A) and (F). Neither <em>punctilious</em>, which means <em>overly concerned with precise formalities</em>, nor <em>salacious</em>, which means <em>obscene</em>, is supported by any clues in the sentence, so eliminate choices (C) and (D).

            <p>The blank refers to the tone of the chair’s remarks, which offended people <em>accustomed to being addressed in a more collegial and egalitarian manner</em>. Thus, you need a word that means <em>non-collegial</em> or <em>non-egalitarian</em>; a simple word like <em>bossy</em> works well. Choices (D) and (E) give roughly synonymous meanings, but nothing in the sentence supports the idea that the speech was <em>optimistic</em>. Neither <em>ignominious</em>, which means <em>shameful,</em> nor <em>saturnine</em>, which means <em>gloomy,</em> makes sense in the blank, so eliminate choices (A) and (F). Both <em>imperious</em> and <em>peremptory</em> can mean <em>bossy,</em> so choices (B) and (C) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

The comments failed to project <em>sophistication</em> and so the blank must be a word that means <em>immature</em>.
