            <p>This is a tricky passage. It talks about the controversies that surround history. It seems that even old history can still get people riled up and there are bound to be opposing views. As always, pay attention to trigger words. The second sentence says, <em>while</em>, which signals that blank (ii) must be different from <em>remains the subject of polarizing debates</em>. This is a change in direction, so one would think there would only be one view. So the second blank should say something like <em>past</em> or <em>over</em>. <em>Free from</em> works the best. Since everything is being argued, we need something negative or argumentative for the last blank. That knocks out <em>mellifluous</em> and <em>objective.</em> The first blank speculates on whether or not historical arguments are ever over. <em>Apolitical</em> is the best stand-in for the end of arguments over history.</p>

          <p> In <em>The Federalist Number Ten</em>, James Madison forewarned against the dangers of factions—groups of people with a common interest adverse to the overall good of the nation, what today are referred to as “special interest groups.” Madison described two hypothetical ways to check a faction: Either eliminate the causes or mitigate the effects of the faction. To eliminate the causes, the government would either have to make all people perfectly equal, an impossible goal, or take away people’s liberty and thus defeat the purpose of having a republican form of government. Madison argued, alternatively, for ameliorating the effects of factions by enlarging the population of the country and thus diluting their influence. If there are a sufficient number of diverse peoples, it will be difficult for a majority to share a common interest at the same time. </p>

          <p> William Le Baron Jenney is considered the founder of the Chicago School of architecture, as well as the father of the American skyscraper. He served as an engineering officer during the Civil War but by 1868 was a practicing architect. His greatest accomplishments were his mammoth commercial buildings, including the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, which was one of the first buildings to use a metal skeleton. This structure, in fact, would become the archetypical American skyscraper design. Other notable accomplishments included his 16-story Manhattan Building, which was the first edifice ever to achieve that height, and the Horticultural Building, which was the largest botanical conservatory ever erected. </p>
          <p> William Holabird also assisted in the evolution of the Chicago School, beginning as a draftsman for Jenney and then founding his own practice in 1880. Holabird invented the “Chicago window,” which made buildings appear to be constructed of glass. </p>

          <p> “Solar wind” is the term scientists use to describe the stream of particles that the sun’s corona constantly emits. These solar winds, which consist mainly of hydrogen and helium, are intensely hot, fully ionized plasma. Because of the corona’s intense heat, these particles continuously escape the sun’s gravitational attraction, flowing away from the sun at extreme velocities. Solar winds, though, are not without variation, because they contain faster and slower moving pockets. For instance, solar winds that originate from streamers are slower moving winds at approximately 300 km/second, as opposed to the winds that originate from corona holes and reach speeds of 800 km/second. As they flow away from the sun, tangential discontinuities and interplanetary shocks form, producing pressure variations. Moreover, researchers also know that solar winds are directly related to geomagnetic storms, auroras, and comets. It is these winds that cause comet tails to bend away from the sun, as Kepler accurately predicted in the early 1600s. </p>
          <p> Studies have been done on the effect of solar winds on the planets in the solar system. While all the planets are surrounded by this hot, super-charged plasma, the Earth’s magnetic field protects it from the solar wind by deflecting the particles. However, solar winds are responsible for the Earth’s magnetosphere, and changes in their speed and direction strongly influence Earth’s space environment. As the planet closest to the sun, Mercury endures the main impact of solar winds. If Mercury had an atmosphere, these winds would have stripped it away, leaving the planet bathed in radiation. Though Mars is much further from the sun than Mercury, solar winds have also greatly reduced its atmosphere. While Venus has a substantial atmosphere—100 times denser than ours—solar winds reduce its clouds. It is not just those planets nearest the sun which bear the effects of solar winds: The winds travel far beyond the limits of Pluto. Interestingly, while much is now known about solar winds, scientists still do not fully understand how the gases and particles in the sun’s corona reach such high velocities. </p>

          <p> The American people have an incorrect understanding of what it means to be at war. At least, so argues T.H. Pickett in his conservative interpretation of American military history. </p>
          <p> Pickett does present a wealth of examples, along with a refreshingly candid argument that America often goes to war for an abstract ideal such as democratization of societies, world peace, liberty, or freedom. For instance, the Spanish-American War of 1898 was ostensibly a consequence of national enthusiasm for the cause of Cuban liberty. And, more obviously, America’s entry into World War I stemmed from a desire to “make the world safe for democracy.” Although these observations are supportable, Pickett overstates the case when he argues that these abstract causes typically lead to a war hysteria in which American leadership can no longer enforce any measured policies. </p>

          <p> Though artist Chuck Close has devoted his life to portraiture, his paintings rarely comport with that genre’s traditional purpose. His early photorealist images, which are created by overlaying a grid on a photograph and painstakingly copying the image cell by cell, are, to the naked eye, nearly undifferentiable from photographs. Furthermore, Close’s emphasis is on the disembodied head itself, expressionless and devoid of any overt personality. He has never acceded to commissions, relying on both his own image and his friends as models. In 1988, a collapsed spinal artery caused almost total paralysis, but Close has continued to work. His freer paintings evince a natural extension of an augmented interest in the minute grid over the total work that predated his illness. This non-privileging of any particular part of the canvas finds its inspiration, oddly enough, in abstract expressionism, despite the apparent inconsonance of the two techniques. </p>

Derrida was considered the originator of a profound challenge to the history of human thought. However, a century before Derrida, Darwin’s theory of natural selection had made anti-foundationalism almost an inevitable consequence.

            <p>The clue here is that Plath <em>produced just two volumes</em>. This phrase, in addition to the comparison to the number of volumes her husband produced, tells you that she did not produce many. Remember that before the blank you have the trigger word <em>not,</em> so you need a word that means productive. Choices (A), (B), (C), and (D) are all adjectives that describe what Plath might or might not have been, but they do not fit the given clue.

            <p>The blank describes what consumers demonstrate when <em>boycotting companies</em>, so a word like <em>disapproval</em> would make sense in the blank. Both <em>endorsement</em> and <em>ratification</em> are nearly the opposite of what you’re looking for, so eliminate choices (A) and (B). Neither <em>debilitation</em>, which means <em>weakening,</em> nor <em>machinations</em>, which means <em>schemes,</em> is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (D) and (E). Both <em>censure</em> and <em>disapprobation</em> can mean <em>disapproval,</em> so choices (C) and (F) give you appropriate, equivalent sentences.</p>

Neither <em>somnolence</em>, which means <em>drowsiness,</em> nor <em>belletrism</em>, which means <em>engagement in the genre of literature known as belles-lettres,</em> is supported by the sentence, so eliminate choices (D) and (F).

            <p>The sentence tells you that <em>animals give predators advanced warning of their danger</em>, so you know the bright colors are warning signs. The <em>while</em> trigger changes the direction of the second part of the sentence, which you can see with the mention of the <em>harmless scarlet kingsnake</em>, but then there’s another contrast with the <em>simply mimic</em> phrase. This brings you back to the animals that are <em>unpalatable or dangerous</em>. You can recycle <em>dangerous</em> for the blank. Eliminate choice (B) right away, because if the animals are dangerous, they definitely aren’t friendly. Choice (D) might initially look appealing, but it actually means <em>beautiful</em>. While the animals might be brightly colored, you’re looking for something that means <em>dangerous</em>, so you can eliminate that answer. You’re left with two sets of synonyms, choices (A) and (E) and choices (C) and (F). The words in the second set, choices (C) and (F), mean <em>edible</em>. If you missed one of the contrast triggers, you might be tempted to go with that pair, but because you have the two different changes of direction, you can eliminate them. That leaves (A) and (E) as the best answers.</p>

            <p>The topic of the text is mummification, which deals with <em>drying out the body</em> and <em>preventing decomposition</em>. There is a contrast, indicated by the <em>while</em> trigger, between the <em>Egyptian pharaoh</em> mummies and the <em>Tarim mummies</em>. The text tells you that the Egyptian mummies were <em>intentionally</em> preserved, so you can fill in the blank with something to indicate the Tarim mummies were <em>naturally preserved</em>. Choices (B) and (C) could be tempting, because the mummies were discovered, but that’s not what the missing word means. Choice (A) has nothing to do with the context of the sentence, and choice (D) is the opposite of what you’re looking for.</p>
